       "['It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as \\\\\"The Kid\\\\\". It is a silent movie but so rich, winning and beautiful that you don\\\\u00b4t nead words. Chaplin and 6-year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life. The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental. I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness. And I really never cry in movies. And the music...its simply Oscar-level! The movie is sympathetic, full of feeling, touchingly funny moments. It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over 80 years old! So don\\\\u00b4t you miss it because of it\\\\u00b4s age, don\\\\u00b4t miss it.',\n",
       " 'They don\\'t make films like this faded, haunting masterpiece of silent cinema anymore.When Dracula was first put on sale for movie rights; the one of the first men to grab it was F.W.Murnau one of the most of the famous German directors of his time. By the time word got back to them about using the rights of the name and storyline of Dracula (Owned by the rights of Florence\\'s widow.) Murnau had alread started production on the film; so to get around it they cut out the name \\'Dracula\\' and replaced it with Count Orlok, Jonathan Harker became Hutter and Ban Helsing became Professor Bulwer; Orlock stalks the gothic streets of Bremen instead of Vistorian London.What is so different from Nosferatu and many of the others films of the time was that most of the film was shot on actually locations around Eastern Europe; the production hardly used any studio sets. What makes the most haunting feature tho is the sense of realism and the expressionism (most evident in the interiors od Orlok\\'s Castle) that gives the film its hypnotic visual power.If there is any film a film student would need to have in his/her collection, it\\'s this film. Although it is a hard task to find any surving copies. The reason for this is when the film was released Florence Stoker (widow of the author of Dracula) noticed the comparsion; she pursued the case relentlessly and in July 1925 a German court ordered all prints of the film to be destroyed. Luckily for us several prints of the film survived; a few in which have still been lost over the last few 8 decades.But thanks to the 2000 release of \\'Shadow of a Vampire\\' a film  which looks behind the filming of Nosferatu and starring John Malkovich (F.W.Murnau) and Willem Dafoe (Count Orlok) the film was released for the first time on DVD in it\\'s full original length of 94 minutes.Sadly soon after the film hit America in 1929; at the age of 43; Murnau was killed in a car crash.\\\\\"Men must die. Nosferatu does not die!\\\\\" proclaimed the original publcity for the film. We can only hope it\\'s the truth for this film.',\n",
       " 'I first viewed this movie in 1924 at age 6 yrs--probably the first movie I ever saw.  I thought it was terrific then, and after viewing it again now(2003) I still think it is an exceptionally fine movie.  Many special effects without benefit of computers.  A very ambitious movie for that time.',\n",
       " 'I doubt that I\\'d ever seen anything resembling a \\\\\"complete\\\\\" version of METROPOLIS before, though certain of its scenes were familiar to me, if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keaton\\'s HEAVEN (1987).  In any case, whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration.  I expected to be distracted by the restoration\\'s technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences, but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  As \\\\\"exaggerated\\\\\" as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards, some performances, such as the Master of the city, are amazingly nuanced and layered, and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film, the unerring camera placement and Lang\\'s muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. I\\'d thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity (\\\\\"important\\\\\" = \\\\\"dull\\\\\") but now I\\'ve come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been.',\n",
       " \"I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie. This is without a doubt the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen! Let me explain my position. We have all seen modern sci-fi movies, and argued over which is the best ever made, but those film makers have high speed film and computers. Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in 1925, and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film, as well as just good fun for everyone. The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold.\",\n",
       " \"The movie is best described as pathetic. It may be good when people had nothing else, but not today. Not even after sound appeared in films. I wonder what the film is doing so high up in the ratings when it was a galactic effort to even sit through it. Metropolis is a complete waste of time. Ever since dialogues appeared in the films, there is not a single film that is considered good without good dialogues. Take any of the top films, even the IMDb top 250 list. There is not a single film that has won its place with run of the mill dialogues. And this one is without sound. Today's audience wants a story, strong dialogue, good acting and effects. The acting is stiff and out of fashion in Metroplis. The excessive use of expressions to make up for lack of sound may be understandable back then, but today it just looks a bit too funny. My recommendation: Don't watch it!\",\n",
       " \"Well i was watching this movie for whatever reason. And it was so boring and the people don't even talk in it. and i don't see how film was entertaining in 1927. i never fall asleep on the couch but i did while watching metropolis. A rich guy wants to be a slave so he can be with a girl. Thats about the time i fell asleep when i woke up i put in Edward Scissorhands instead and That was a good movie and i didn't fall asleep to it. I don't know what else to type for ten lines i hate this stupid rule do i have ten lines yet no i do not ahhh! I need ten lines to finish this review i think i almost have ten lines i think i do!Botom Line In 1927 maybeNow a days Terrible movie who watches these kind of movies anymore!\",\n",
       " 'Buster Keaton once said that if he hadn\\'t been a comedian, he might have been a civil engineer. He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. It\\'s no wonder he adored trains, the most elegant of machines, and brought them into his movies whenever he could. When one of Keaton\\'s former gag-writers loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War, he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this \\\\\"page of history\\\\\" to life. His first certainty was that the production had to be \\\\\"so authentic it hurts.\\\\\" He even insisted on using historically accurate narrow-gauge railroad tracks, which he found, along with appropriate landscapes, near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove, Oregon.Most importantly, the area had stretches of parallel tracks, which allowed scenes of Buster on his train-agilely scrambling over the cars, balancing on the roof to scan the horizon, chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind him-to be filmed from another train running alongside. Buster, his train, and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Buster\\'s hair while smoky pine-covered hills rise and fall around him. These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures, and they put to shame all later back-projection and process shots, models and computer-generated effects. The quality of Keaton\\'s film-making is simply-pun intended-unparalleled. Every shot in The General is clean, fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times. The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional, just like the grave, masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniforms.The General\\'s narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look. Like a train, it stays on track, never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt. All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline. Adapting the historical incident, Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train (Johnnie Gray), rather than one of the raiders. As he saw immediately, The General is one long chase, or rather two chases, structured like the flight of a boomerang. First Johnnie on a borrowed train, the Texas, chases his own stolen train, the General. He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines, pursued by the raiders in the Texas, who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command.The General is not Keaton\\'s funniest film, but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs. A number of the gags, like the box-car that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks, have a long build-up for a relatively modest payoff. But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe, and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings. The cannon attached to the back of Buster\\'s train goes off just as the train starts around a curve, so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders\\' train coming out of the curve. Riding on the cowcatcher, Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks, striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way. A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his train\\'s wheels, so lost in thought he doesn\\'t notice when the train starts to move, carrying him up and down in gentle arcs: stillness in motion.I agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keaton\\'s most personal film, the one that best captures his unique vision, spirit and personality. In many of his films, Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero. But his competent, ingenious and athletic character in The General, who is also modest, tireless, and underestimated, comes much closer to his real nature. There is a shot in The General of Buster\\'s eye isolated on screen, framed by a hole in a white table-cloth, that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertov\\'s kinoglaz, the \\\\\"camera-eye.\\\\\" Keaton melds with his camera; there\\'s no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies. They have the same silence, the same strictness, the same strange blend of gravity and humor.The General might be the most serious comedy every made, but it\\'s not a tragicomedy. That, as in Chaplin\\'s blending of pathos and low humor, was something people took to immediately. But no one knew what to make of The General. Original reviews accused the film of being dull, pretentious, unoriginal, and unfunny. Even today, people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing. The General is challenging because it doesn\\'t flaunt its virtues; like Keaton\\'s concise and economical performance, it holds a great deal in reserve. Take the movie\\'s most famous shot, of a train crashing through a burning bridge, for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train. The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film: he doesn\\'t dwell on it or hype it. Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience, never manipulates, never overplays. He doesn\\'t show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents, nor does he play for sympathy. Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold. But for those who can see the expressiveness of Buster\\'s so-called \\\\\"stone face,\\\\\" who get his peculiar dry humor, who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed, these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated. Buster Keaton always has more than he\\'s showing; you can see it in his eyes.',\n",
       " 'Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplin\\'s \\\\\"City Lights\\\\\" a masterpiece. It\\'s only 81 minutes long, but they are among the best 81 minutes you could spend at the movies, and the last five minutes are simply exquisite. Keep your Kleenex box at arm\\'s length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film. When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says \\\\\"Yes, I can see now\\\\\", the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanation.Chaplin was at his zenith in 1928 when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story, and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade. He had already made the classics \\\\\"The Gold Rush\\\\\" (1925) and \\\\\"The Circus\\\\\" (1928) starring his character, so it\\'s obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time. The advent of talkies didn\\'t stop Chaplin from making this \\\\\"Comedy Romance in Pantomime\\\\\" (as he subtitled it), as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a well-mannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down, even going to prison for love. It is this self-delusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl, played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill. Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film, as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable. Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale, Chaplin\\'s leading lady in \\\\\"The Gold Rush\\\\\" and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill, as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the \\\\\"wealthy\\\\\" gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sight.Of course, this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes - the rising and lowering of the street elevator, the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub, the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene, which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers (and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra, inspired by an earlier Chaplin short \\\\\"The Champion\\\\\" from 1915). Even a simple moment, for example, when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine, is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment. And special mention needs to go to Chaplin\\'s musical score, where he beautifully interweaves Jos\\\\u00e9 Padilla\\'s \\\\\"La Violetta\\\\\" as his love theme.The transfer to DVD is very good, and the 2-DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality. The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film, and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the long-forgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then. The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long. The 10-minute home movie of Chaplin\\'s trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise. Regardless, the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplin\\'s reputation as one of the world\\'s leading filmmakers.',\n",

       " '\\\\\"Dracula\\\\\" is a true cinematic classic that still hold up well today more than 70 years after its initial release. Bram Stoker\\'s novel had been filmed before, most notably the 1922 German masterpiece \\\\\"Nosferatu\\\\\" with Max Schrenk playing the vampire as a monstrous rat like creature with no redeeming qualities. Bela Lugosi rose to instant fame with his portrayal of Dracula, a part he had been playing on stage for several years. Lugosi\\'s interpretation is that of a suave and sophisticated nobleman with a hypnotic stare and a cultured Hungarian accent. This made the character more appealing to the ladies while at the same time terrifying to the audience when we see the monster revealed beneath. The story has the tragic Renfield (Dwight Frye) arriving in Transylvania to complete a transaction with the Count which will allow him to lease a English castle. Before they leave for England by ship, Dracula turns Renfield into a quasi-vampire who obeys his master\\'s every command. Upon arriving in England it is discovered that all of the ship\\'s crew have been murdered and only a raving lunatic of a Renfield remain alive. Renfield is committed to a sanitarium run by Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston). Dracula seeks him out and discovers Seward\\'s comely daughter Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy. Dracula quickly \\\\\"kills\\\\\" Lucy and sets his sights upon Mina whose fiance Jonathon Harker (David Manners) is baffled by her sudden change in health and personality. Seward consults with a colleague Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) who quickly identifies the source of the problem as a vampire. They soon expose Dracula for what he is and...... The atmospheric sets of this movie set the tone for the story. Dracula\\'s castle is dark, damp and web filled and his cellar is positively scary. So too is his English manor with the classic winding stair case leading to the cellar. The opening theme I found to be equally foreboding and frightening. I wonder how many of those early film goers realized that it was adapted from the classic ballet \\\\\"Swan Lake\\\\\". Bela Lugosi should have become a major star after this film, but did not. His first mistake was the turning down the role of the monster in \\\\\"Frankenstein\\\\\" (1931). He did enjoy moderate success in the first half of the 30s playing various mad scientists and criminal masterminds. But he also accepted roles in several \\\\\"poverty row\\\\\" quickies which did little to advance his career. He had a brief return to glory in 1939 when he played \\\\\"Ygor\\\\\" in \\\\\"The Son of Frankenstein\\\\\" and again in 1948 again as Dracula in \\\\\"Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein\\\\\". With his well documented personal demons, Lugosi wound up his career in cheap \\\\\"B\\' movies ultimately becoming the \\\\\"star\\\\\" in some of Ed Wood\\'s \\\\\"classics\\\\\". Oddly enough, though he was forever identified with the Dracula character, he only played him on screen twice, in 1931 and 1948 as noted. He did play \\\\\"Dracula like\\\\\" characters in MGM\\'s \\\\\"Mark of the Vampire\\\\\" (1935) and in Columbia\\'s \\\\\"Return of the Vampire\\\\\" (1943). Dwight Frye almost steals \\\\\"Dracula\\\\\" from Lugosi with his portrayal of Renfield. He takes him from a young ambitious businessman to a half crazed lunatic and back again. After this and his role of Fritz the hunchback in \\\\\"Frankenstein\\\\\", this great character actor never again achieved such heights. A real tragedy. Oddly enough, Stoker\\'s book portrays Renfield as a minor character and it is Jonathon Harker who makes the unfortunate trip to Transylvania. Also filmed in a Spanish language version.',\n",

The setting of the Old House on a dark rainy night is brilliantly done and the mood is held all the way through.  The cast is excellent headed By Boris Karloff as the sometimes out-of-control Morgan, and Charles Laughton is a delight in his very off-beat role.  Raymond Massey and Melvyn Douglas both contribute to the fun as does Gloria Stuart, but the creme-de-la-creme comes from Emma Dunn and Ernest Thesiger as the Femms - who can ever forget Mrs. Femm saying \\\\\"No beds, you can\\'t have beds!\\\\\", or Mr. Femm offering the guests at meal time \\\\\"Have a Potato\\\\\".

Most of the speeches deal with then-current events in Germany, so it's a good idea to read a history book if you're not familiar with them, to fully understand the movie. Some scenes are absolutely fascinating: Hess's opening speech, Hither addressing Labour Movement and the SA/SS meeting. P.S.

       " 'Most people associate Hitchcock with suspense but he was also a master of dark comedy. \\\\\"The 39 Steps\\\\\" illustrates his ability to blend the two genres into a movie that works well on both levels. If he had turned up the comedy a tiny bit it would be just as hilarious as the best 1930\\'s screwball comedies like \\\\\"Bringing Up Baby\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Awful Truth\\\\\". Imagine Katherine Hepburn handcuffed to Robert Donat as they wander the Scottish moors. But the chemistry between Madeleine Carroll and Donat is too good to replace her. Hitchcock cast a great ensemble for \\\\\"The 39 Steps\\\\\". Lucie Mannheim, Godfrey Teale and John Laurie are outstanding. The supporting cast are all excellent. Yet in the midst of all this it is Peggy Ashcroft who absolutely shines.Donat\\'s misadventures while \\\\\"on-the-run\\\\\" from the law are the original \\\\\"series of unfortunate events\\\\\". It seems that he just can\\'t go anywhere without being identified and chased. Hitchcock\\'s technique is to lull you into thinking it will be an ordinary scene and then to casually throw something menacing into the scene, so the viewer can never relax. These are like getting a slap in the face before you have a chance to set yourself up for the blow. By comparison with the sinister delicacy and urbane understatement of \\\\\"The Thirty-nine Steps,\\\\\" modern melodramas are obvious and crude. There are many cool things to watch for: CAMEO-As Donat and Mannheim board a bus early in the film, director Hitchcock makes his customary cameo appearance as a passer-by who tosses litter onto the sidewalk.MATCH CUT-One of the most revolutionary edits in cinema history is in here; after the maid finds Lucie\\'s body her scream dissolves into the hissing of a train whistle. MISE EN SCENE-If you ever wandered what this was (\\\\\"putting-in-the-scene\\\\\" is a single shot sequence without cuts to another camera or transition to another scene), Hitchcock\\'s closing shot is probably the all-time best example. As Donat, Carroll, and the police gather backstage around the dying Mr. Memory, on-stage behind them (visible from the wings) and performing for the Palladium audience is a chorus-line of girls high-kicking to the tune of Tinkle, Tinkle, Tinkle from the film Evergreen (1934). After Mr. Memory confirms the espionage plot, the camera angle changes slightly and Donat and Carroll fill the frame facing away from the camera. Donat still has the handcuffs dangling from his wrist. They spontaneously join hands - this time of their own free will.. The film fades to black.',\n",
       " 'DODSWORTH (United Artists, 1936), directed by William Wyler, stars Walter Huston (1884-1950) in what is rightfully acclaimed to be his best screen performance in a motion picture career that spanned from 1929 until his death in 1950. Recreating the role he originated on Broadway in 1934, and based on the novel by Sinclair Lewis, this Samuel Goldwyn production is a perfectly transferred masterpiece.The story revolves around Samuel Dodsworth (Walter Huston), a millionaire industrialist of Zenith, Ohio, president and founder of Dodsworth Motor Company, who, after twenty years of building up his automobile establishment, sells it over to Union Motors, and leaves the factory with fond memories of hard work behind him. Now retired, he finds that he must succumb to his wife Fran (Ruth Chatterton), whose main goal is to enjoy life starting with an extensive six month European vacation from London to Paris. While on their continental tour on the Queen Mary, Sam excites himself by seeing the world for the first time while his wife, yearning for a more sophisticated existence, tries to recapture her youth by winning admiration with younger or sophisticated men: Captain Clyde Lockert (David Niven), and Arnold Iselin (Paul Lukas), a suave international banker, each becoming short-lived affairs. As Fran entertains herself without Sam, Sam finds good company with Edith Cortright (Mary Astor) a American divorc\\\\u00e9e traveling alone. What was originally intended to be a sort of second honeymoon for this middle-aged couple, Sam and Fran find that, after years of marriage, they have become strangers, drifting apart. Fran becomes even more bitter when she learns that her now grown married daughter (Kathryn Marlowe) is expecting a child, making Fran to realize that she is to become a grandmother. Still deeply in love with Fran, Sam is unwilling to profess to himself that she is a selfish woman trying to hold on to her youth but reluctantly consents to Fran\\'s request to get a divorce. Traveling around the world alone, Sam reacquaints himself with Edith Cortright. As for Fran, she finds love with the impoverished Kurt Von Obersdorf (Gregory Gaye), with whom she plans to marry. After meeting Kurt\\'s aristocratic but strong-willed mother (Maria Ouspenskaya), who is totally against this marriage, Fran becomes mortified when she\\'s asked, \\\\\"Have you ever thought what it would be like to be the old wife of a young husband?\\\\\" As for Sam, his life has become a renewed experience with Edith at her Italian villa until Fran informs him she wants to come back into his life again. Walter Huston, more an actor than star, makes a perfect Dodsworth. He even delivers the film\\'s most memorable line, \\\\\"Love has to stop someplace short of suicide.\\\\\" Ruth Chatterton, a capable actress whose career by then was then on the wane, gives one of her best on-screen performances, in fact, her last great performance ever recorded on film. Her classic moment is telling her husband, Sam, \\\\\"You\\'re rushing at old age. I\\'m not ready for that yet!\\\\\" Sadly, many of her previous screen efforts are overlooked and forgotten today. Years before cable television dominated the airwaves, DODSWORTH appeared to be the only Ruth Chatterton movie in circulation on commercial or late night television. While Fay Bainter, who co-starred opposite Huston in the stage version of DODSWORTH, would have been equally excellent in the role of Fran, Chatterton\\'s performance nearly dominates without taking away from Huston\\'s performance. At times she could become annoying, but that\\'s the essence to her character. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, Huston did get recognized for his performance as Best Actor as did the movie for Best Picture. Curiously, Ruth Chatterton performance was overlooked by the judges of the academy. What\\'s even more ironic is that Maria Ouspenskaya, making her movie debut, in a performance that takes up no more than five minutes, earned an award for Best Supporting Actress, the nomination that should have been offered to Mary Astor, who not only has more screen time, but is more essential to the story. Aside from that, Astor, who was playing a woman some years older than her true age, is strikingly beautiful and shares the film\\'s now many classic scenes, including the one where she looks eye to eye at Fran (who claims to be 35), and telling her, \\\\\"Don\\'t.\\\\\" Her one word says it all. What also makes the movie succeed, even after all these years, is the frankness and very adult-minded theme dealing with realities of mid-life crisis. Next to Paramount\\'s MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW (1937), DODSWORTH is the only known major motion picture of that time to bring out the realities of old age openly and honestly. The Alfred Newman underscoring which sets the mood and dramatic appeal is also an added plus as well as part of the Samuel Goldwyn trademark.Supporting players include Spring Byington, Odette Myrtil, and John Payne, billed as John Howard Payne, making his movie debut, as Harry, Emily Dodsworth\\'s husband.DODSWORTH became one of many Samuel Goldwyn features to be distributed to video cassette. Aside from its many revivals on commercial television since the 1970s, DODSWORTH did enjoy frequent showings on cable television\\'s American Movie Classics in 1993, and more than a decade later, premiered March 1, 2004, on Turner Classic Movies. DODSWORTH, winner of one Academy Award, for which best art direction by Richard Day, is the type of movie once seen, it\\'s hard to forget, and improves itself with repeated viewing. Producer Samuel Goldwyn accomplished in transporting a stage play into a cinematic achievement. Not once during its presentation did DODSWORTH have the appearance of a filmed stage play. In spite that DODSWORTH in not becoming as better known as it deserves to be, it still ranks one of the finest and most adult stories ever to be produced in the 1930s. Huston, Chatterton and Astor, all deliver excellent performances under William Wyler\\'s superb direction. (****)',\n",

       " 'This early sci-fi masterwork by Herbert George Wells with music by Arthur Bliss is a powerful piece of film-making. Adapted from Wells\\' somewhat different work by the author, it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of \\'peace\\'. The structure is that after a contrasted-pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war, the script allows the war to happen. Two families, the Cabells and the Passworthys disagree about what may happen; Passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization\\'s \\\\\"automatic\\\\\" progress; Cabell is the thinker, the doubter. Their city Everytown--obviously London-- becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks, a magnificent war march by Bliss, and the end of civilization. The second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a \\\\\"Boss\\\\\", played with bravura by Ralph Richardson, whose woman, lovely Margaretta Scott, is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete-bound dictator type. He is trying to rebuild old WWI airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom; a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes--etc.--everlastingly; this is Wells\\' comment on war versus progress. The survivors are subject to a plague called \\\\\"The Wandering Sickness\\\\\" also. Enter a modern flying machine piloted by the Cabell of the first section of the film, now part of Wings Over the World, an International Scientists\\' Coalition, who are planning to end warfare forever. This flight-suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the Boss and his woman, their attraction being evident; then Boss sends up his aircraft against them, the Scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the \\\\\"Gas of Peace\\\\\" onto the ruins of Everytown. Only the Boss dies, fighting too hard against the pacifying. The film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers. In section three, a future Cabell argues with a future Passworthy over the morality of human science. Passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the Moon; Cabell champions man\\'s right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons. The son of Passworthy and Cabell\\'s daughter, are the astronauts being sent. Theotocopulos, a religious-minded Luddite, makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city\\'s Forum and leads an attack on the \\'space gun\\' that is to fire the new rocket free of Earth\\'s gravity. The climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully; the denouement and ending is a speech by Cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned. \\\\\"It is all the universe--or nothing!\\\\\" Cabell tells Passworthy. \\\\\"Which shall it be?\\\\\" As Cabell, Raymond Massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance; he is thoughtful, compassionate, and reasonable, a true scientist. As the rabble-rouser who wants to end the Age of Science, Cedric Hardwicke is perfect and powerful. Edward Chapman playing Passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear. The storyline is logical, frequently beautiful and always interesting. Given the near-extinction of mankind, the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer. This is a triumph for the director, William Cameron Menzies, for Bliss and for all concerned. Listen to the dialogue with someone you love; within its constructed limits, this is a thinking man\\'s drama debating two possible human futures--progress or its reactionary opposite.',\n",

       " \"What an amazing experience to see The Adventures Of Robin Hood 80 years after its original release. How can one explain the longevity of its relevance. Relevant in every department. Acting to start with. Errol Flynn was not considered a great actor, never an Oscar nomination or anything like that. Bette Davis was always frustrated for having to work opposite him rather that Laurence Olivier. But, look at him now, 80 years later - Erroll Flynn' s performance is as fresh today as the day he filmed it. Compare that with Oscar winner Russell Crowe's Robin Hood (2010) - Russell Crowe even had the impertinence of mocking Erroll Flynn's version. This bit of tribia kuind of depressed me after the high of seeing again this Michael Curtiz's masterpiece. Here, everything works. Other than Erroll Flynn - even if when's he is on the screen is difficult to pay attention to anyone else - we do. Mostly because Claude Rains, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and the rest of the sensational cast. This adventure film will continue to captivate audiences for years, decades, centuries to come.\",\n",

       " \"Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.Million Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently.If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection.I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her, but because of that he's on to all her ploys.Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though, he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie.It's a deceptive part, superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her's.And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.Hattie's a shrewd judge of character, she's a slave, but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says, she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.And I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now.\",\n",

       " 'Women having cat fights over men never looked better than they did in George Cukor\\'s adaptation of Clare Boothe-Luce\\'s hit Broadway play. An all-star cast of actresses (which included the established, the Broadway vets, and the rising in one huge ensemble), THE WOMEN never once seems as if it\\'s aged a bit because its story could very well be placed in a modern setting. The only shame I think is that its release coincided with the year 1939. There were too many other movies that were already vying for recognition and because of this massive competition it got lost in the shuffle. Had its release been withheld until the following year, there\\'s no doubt it would have gotten at least an acting nomination, or multiple nominations in different categories including best picture.The story at the center is any woman\\'s nightmare: that her husband is having an affair and that everyone but her knows about it. Norma Shearer is this woman. She plays Mary Haines, happily married to Stephen Haines and mother of Little Mary. She has no idea that Stephen is having a torrid affair with perfume clerk Crystal Allen, but Sylvia does (as does everyone else) and plans to have Mary find out about it. Sylvia uses the communication skills of a manicurist to have Mary find out about her husband\\'s secret, and things boil up to a crescendo at a fashion show when both Mary and Crystal meet and spar. Mary decides after an argument to leave her husband in a quickie divorce signing at Reno where she meets not only the eccentric Countess deLave but Miriam Aarons, who is the other woman in the Fowler marriage. Sylvia later also arrives in tears and then finds out that Miriam is set to be the next Mrs. Fowler and a fight ensues. At the last moment, Mary gets a call from Stephen: he will marry Crystal Allen after all. Crystal, now the new Mrs. Stephen Haines, takes to his money and her new lifestyle with a vengeance and makes Stephen pretty miserable. On top of that, she is carrying on with a new guy, Buck, who was up to now the Countess deLave\\'s husband. Sylvia of course learns of this, and the news reaches Mary\\'s ears, who tries to win back her husband and re-kindle her marriage using the same viciousness used against her.At first glance this is a pretty straightforward comedy of manners among the women who inhabit this world -- who are more real than anyone would like to imagine. However, there are a lot of little elements that the script adaptation of Booth-Luce\\'s play tell about women and how they see not only other women in society, rich or poor, but how they see themselves in a world where the next young thing could displace them and their perfect homes. In essence, this is the first movie to tackle the issue of divorce so successfully and movies like THE FIRST WIVES\\' CLUB and the TV soaps MELROSE PLACE and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES owe a lot to THE WOMEN. The use of the term \\'sister\\' is an interesting one, it being at the heart of the feminist movement -- female bonding is one of the film\\'s strongest points and serves as a counterpart to the viciousness that we see early on. Interesting that Miriam Aarons, herself an \\\\\"other woman\\\\\" is the first to come up with the term. She is the exact opposite of Crystal Allen. She also comes from the streets but is a well-meaning woman and Paulette Goddard plays her like she herself has been there.Cukor definitely knows his actresses and extracts their best performances of their careers. Of the main actresses, the only one to have been past her prime is Norma Shearer but she gives here her last great performance. Restrained, at times even underplayed, vulnerable in a world of female sharks, watch for the scene when she collapses into tears at the news that her husband will marry another woman. This other woman, played by Joan Crawford at a time when she needed the boost in her career (albeit a temporary one), is vicious, made of steel, and Crawford sinks her teeth and claws into Crystal, all growls and purrs, and literally walks off with the movie. Too bad she wasn\\'t considered for a Best Supporting Oscar. This is her best performance on screen, multi-layered, fascinating. An interesting sequence between her and Virginia Weidler (who outdoes her admirably in a sensitive role) playing Mary\\'s daughter is one with future \\\\\"Mommie Dearest\\\\\" echoes. And needless to say the rich comedic timing that Rosalind Russell brings to pretty horrific character, Sylvia Fowler. What an actress! She pulls out all the stops in her scenes, going from plain bitchy, to conniving, to furious, to deceived, and all the time in that rapid-fire speech of hers. Marjorie Main, Mary Boland, Lucille Watson, and Joan Fontaine are all great -- well written characters all directed by the equally great George Cukor who has created a timeless classic with this movie.',\n",

       " 'Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ, with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new, it can\\'t be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives, especially as children, has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced, the terror of entering the Wicked Witch\\'s lair, her transition from little girl to wise young woman, and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.What makes a great movie? The experience that you are watching it for the very first time, whether you were seven years old or an adult living in an adult world. This film is one of those. Even when as an adult I can see some of the cracks peeking through and some lapses in continuity, who cares? The tornado ripping through the cornfields is as real as the real ones I have seen even though is was really muslin. The moment that the sepia-tones from the Kansas segment peel away and Dorothy opens the door of her house and I saw the bright colors of Oz I knew I was there. The story had enveloped me now, as it had did back then. In my world, this is an utterly, fantastic film.And what is Oz, by the way? Well, from a little girl (and the child in all of us), it\\'s that place where our imagination runs wild, where everything is perfect, where there is no tomorrow and a yellow brick road will take us to that perfect place filled with song. It\\'s that place where we feel we will belong, and who as a child didn\\'t feel like we were out of place? Notice I repeat the word \\'place\\' because this is so much about placement, places, our place and therefore, our own self-expression, our own sense of self. Who hasn\\'t wanted to \\\\\"seek a place of one\\'s own\\' where light and love prevailed only to return back to where we came from, stronger and wiser? Its message is so universal. Truly, there is no place like home.Timing is crucial for the symbolic success of this movie as well. Still in the middle of the Depression years, when unemployment was at an all time high, it focuses not just on the harshness of keeping a farm, but then throwing a parent-less girl into a strange land who finds a foster mother of sorts who would tell her that the way back home would not be an easy one. Glinda the Good represents this character, the same way, the Wicked Witch of the West represents the darker forces that watch her every move and aggressively try to trip her up. This is quite a lot on the shoulders of a little girl, and having Judy Garland -- not yet the major star but just on the brink of becoming one -- play Dorothy Gale has become casting history. In 1939 she was about seventeen, fresh-faced, innocent and vulnerable: she is Dorothy, and we can\\'t imagine anyone else, not even nearly 70 years later.And speaking of casting, it was genius to have the actors playing Dorothy\\'s friends and enemies in Kansas also show up in Oz. Since the movie is so much like a dream, it\\'s more than logical: many people in our lives sometimes show up in dreams -- it\\'s even in books about dreams. That they also represent that which not only they, but Dorothy most of all, lacks -- courage, love, and wisdom -- makes their appearances even more intrinsic to the story, so when they grow as characters, so do we, and of course, so does Dorothy.THE WIZARD OF OZ is timeless. So simple, so honest, but so deep in its messages about love and self-discovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook; all that is missing are the page frames. There isn\\'t a false move here, and all those back-stories... well, their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic, it\\'s all here, in about two hours of pure entertainment.',\n",

       " \"I was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.\",\n",

Throughout this movie, I sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.\",\n",

Imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the USA's foreign policy?This film is hilarious, poignant and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end, but it is already to late - for him and for us.

Very final scene with a young Robert Stack and his brother is chilling. The message of this film of standing up against adversity and what you believe in, is as fresh today as in 1940 when this film was released. Cast is marvelous with a toss up between Jimmy Stewart and Frank Morgan (who played the wizard in Oz the year before) to who steals the film. But then everyone is good in this.

       " 'There are a hundred great things about \\\\\"Pinocchio\\\\\".  Pleasure Island, for one.  I\\'m amazed how quick the Disney artists were to discover that the multiplane camera, as well as providing accurate perspective and spectacular landscape shots, could be used more subtly to suggest sinister murk.  (We get a similar effect in \\\\\"Fantasia\\\\\" in the first half of \\\\\"The Rite of Spring\\\\\".)  And Lampwick\\'s transformation into a donkey is a disturbing moment, for many reasons ... today they might have made the mistake of using flashy computer morphing, which would have been a mistake: expert animation and cutting gives us the distinct impression - almost all done with shadows - that there is a donkey BREAKING THROUGH from inside; which, in his case, is metaphorically accurate.  (Probably the reason Pinocchio survives us that he is as free from native vice as from native virtue.  He must LEARN to adopt the mind-set of Pleasure Island.  This takes time: time enough for him to escape.)But there\\'s much, much more: clever use of songs (note the obvious, but none the less effective, irony of \\\\\"I\\'ve Got No Strings\\\\\"); daring use of stark WHITE backgrounds as well dense crowded ones; an intelligent, mythic story; a wonderful dash of humanity in the form of a cricket; a good musical score; rich atmosphere.  The last is hard to describe.  Of all Disney\\'s films this one has the most pronounced Old World feeling, yet it doesn\\'t seem to take place anywhere in particular - not even in Italy.  Nor does it seem to take place in any particular era.  I fear that no modern film could be so imprecisely evocative; the artistic innocence in which \\\\\"Pinocchio\\\\\" was forged may be lost forever.',\n",
       " 'Alfred Hitchcock was and is still the undisputed Master of Suspense, and there is a lot of that here in his foray into Gothic horror, as the mystery surrounding the unseen yet omnipresent Rebecca will engage the viewer from its dreamy start to its bleak conclusion. This is exactly what atmospheric is supposed to be about, and in black and white, it shines. This is also what Gothic horror is in essence, and many have imitated yet come up short, most notably M. Night Shyamalan who, in trying to go for a shock twist and purported \\\\\"atmosphere\\\\\" only creates a bad aftertaste and a hangover the size of Mount Everest. This is, essentially, Hitchcock\\'s first true masterpiece.Not one performance rings false, not to the novel or to their respective interpretations. Lawrence Olivier, quite possibly one of the greatest actors that ever lived, portrays a broken man who still lives haunted by the past as he himself were still living in that unending hell. Judith Anderson embodies one of the most coldly sadistic figures in cinema history, her smooth and elegant truculence only exceeded by Anthony Hopkins\\' rendition of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. One can\\'t seem to understand the way she wallows in her dead mistresses\\' clearly perverse nature, but that exactly she does, right down to her own end. George Sanders does what he does best: sneer, smirk, and spit line after line of practiced venom, and would be honored 10 years later in ALL ABOUT EVE. Gladys Cooper, still striking in her 50s, plays into her casual cattiness which means no harm, although her rendition of Beatrice Lacy is a little subdued from the novel\\'s version.And then there is Joan Fontaine. Not one of the best actresses on film, yet here, playing a role that evolves beautifully from a frightened, weak girl who is put into a situation she does not understand and who turns right at the point of losing it into a much more mature, strong woman capable of holding her own, she carries the weight of the entire drama and comes forth with flying colors. While I would have preferred Anne Baxter who would have been the exact right age for this role, Fontaine exudes so much restraint and nervousness about her character (partially to blame Olivier\\'s treatment of her and Hitchcock\\'s telling her the entire cast hated her), it\\'s almost a relief when she finally decides to confront Olivier about what it the secret of Manderley. Not many roles require such a change and not many actresses would sink her teeth into a part that requires being put-upon until she can\\'t stand no more, and this is one beautiful performance.A movie that should have won more Oscars that year, REBECCA has since grown in stature and proved that a film need not trophies to be Timeless and Great.',\n",
       " 'When pressed to name her favorite of her own films, Vivien Leigh brushed aside both GONE WITH THE WIND and STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE in favor of this now little-known film based on a failed 1930s stage drama of the same name previously filmed in 1931 with Mae Clark: WATERLOO BRIDGE, directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Leigh had good reason for her choice. Although she was dazzling as Scarlett O\\'Hara and elegantly depraved as Blanche DuBois, she was never as beautifully photographed as she was in this 1940 film.WATERLOO BRIDGE is perhaps best described as one of a number of films \\\\\"with an English accent\\\\\" that played to American sympathies for England in the years when England largely stood alone against Nazi Germany. The story itself has a wartime setting: beautiful ballerina Myra (Vivien Leigh) meets and falls passionately in love with officer Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor), only to be parted from him when he is called to duty during World War I. Alone and increasingly destitute, she learns that he has been killed in action--and so, broken hearted and unconcerned for herself, she drifts into prostitution, plying the world\\'s oldest profession along Waterloo Bridge.Although Robert Taylor is a bit miscast, Leigh carries the film with a truly remarkable performance. In the opening portion of the scene, she is at the height of her youthful beauty, and cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg makes the most of it; later, when experience has hardened her, she turns the graceful charm of her earlier scenes upside down to create the bitter, brassy tart that Myra has become. The cast also features an exceptional performance by Lucile Watson as Lady Margaret and notable turns by Maria Ouspenskaya, C. Aubrey Smith, and a host of others.Although less well known than such tragic romances as Garbo\\'s CAMILLE, WATERLOO BRIDGE is easily the equal of such and considerably better than most. The romantic aura is powerful, the production values are meticulous, the direction, photography, and script are first rate. And at the center of it all we have perhaps the single most beautiful actress of her era, Vivien Leigh, in one of her finest performances. You\\'ll need a box of tissues for this one; don\\'t miss it.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer',\n",

As economic times worsen, the family and community fray and slowly disintegrate.  The backdrop village becomes darker and smokier as the family fights valiantly to remain together.  But unlike the treatment the story would probably get today, the family does not lose its dignity.There is not much, if anything, to criticize in this movie, it's one of the best ever.\",\n",
       " 'Greatest movie of all time. I saw this first during World War II, and it made such an impression upon me that I had to go back time after time. Now 60 years later it lingers in my memory over any other movie I have ever seen. No movie before or since has left such a lasting impression upon me.It could easily be brought back to the modern screen as a classic film that will never die. I wish I could own it on DVD, but I have no idea where I can obtain it. It would be at the top of classic films of all time as an asset in my library. It appeared at a time in our history when the world was being torn asunder and we did not know what tomorrow would bring. It was so uplifting at a time when we needed that uplift.',\n",

I found it so gripping when they were on screen together. What a dynamic duo. The story between Rick and Ilsa was so compelling in every way. The story also led into the narrative of Victor Laszlo (Henreid) and Sam (played by the superb Dooley Wilson who sang \\\\\"As Time Goes By\\\\\"). Another great part of the movie was in Rick\\'s bar club where Ilsa and Rick met again in Casablanca. But as far as the songs, plot and characters go, I thought the utmost part of the movie that made me think \\\\\"wow\\\\\" was without a doubt the ending.

       " \"I've seen Random Harvest a number of times, but recently I watched it twice as part of TCM's Essentials series hosted by Sidney Pollack. This time I was inspired to read the James Hilton novel, Random Harvest, which I recommend to all lovers of the film. If you know the film, you won't get the little surprise at the end of the book -- you will know it already -- but it's still a most enjoyable and heartwarming read. You will see that Smithy/Charles Rainier is quite a young man at the beginning -- however, I did not find Ronald Colman too old in the role, he overcomes the age difference with his splendid performance. And he doesn't seem too old to play Charles Rainier, the prince of industry. I can't imagine another pair who could play the two romantic leads, Greer Garson is so radiant. And all of us who watch old films know that people did look more mature back then -- they looked like real adults! This is such a romantic film, everyone should see it. And Sidney Pollack was right not to remake it -- let well enough alone!\",\n",

       " '\\\\\"I Walked with a Zombie\\\\\", besides having one of the oddest movie titles, took a different approach to the horror genre than the popular Universal movies of the day. Maybe it harkens back to the earlier Universal heavies like \\\\\"Dracula\\\\\" and \\\\\"Bride of Frankenstein\\\\\". Made by Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur, they crafted their collaborations using a poetic, dreamlike approach to cinematic storytelling.  Lyrical and atmospheric, \\\\\"I Walked with a Zombie\\\\\" recounts the story of a Canadian nurse sent to a small West Indian sugar island to tend for a young comatose woman, the wife of the island\\'s plantation owner. What\\'s wrong with her? Hints abound through the songs of the calypso singers, bits of dialogue, objects in the movie. The story, as odd as it is, is not told directly. You may think it is, but at the end of the film, you\\'re not so certain of what\\'s happened. Were the events the work of the supernatural? Was a crime committed? Or both? Or neither?  It\\'s difficult to say.  I recommend this movie, it\\'s important not to forget the older, off-beat films.',\n",
       " 'It is well known that this film is Alfred Hitchcock\\'s favourite of his own oeuvre, and it\\'s a big favourite of mine also. It is also well documented that for this film, Hitchcock stated that he \\\\\"wants to bring violence back into the home, where it belongs\\\\\" and he has certainly succeeded at doing that. Hitchcock spends much of the early screen time building up the family at the centre of the tale, and then allowing the violence to come to them, which shows Hitchcock\\'s mastery of the medium as showing the story develop in this way makes the tale much more frightening than if we hadn\\'t got to know the family at the centre of the story first. Joseph Cotten stars as uncle Charlie; a man fleeing Philadelphia to escape the law after marrying and then murdering several rich widows. He goes to stay with his sister and her family, which includes a husband, two young children and the eldest daughter; his niece and namesake; also called \\'Charlie\\'.Hitchcock puts the focus of the story on young Charlie and her relationship with her uncle. This gives the story a frightening angle as it follows the classic tale of the strange uncle. It\\'s also well done as young Charlie is shown to be the sweetest of characters, and when the dark uncle Charlie enters the fray, her sweet world is infected by nightmares, which also gives way to elements of the classic \\'coming of age\\' tale to enter the proceedings. As if that wasn\\'t enough, Shadow of a Doubt also exposes the trust we put in our loved ones, and how any person is likely to try and shift the blame, or ignore it completely, if their loved one has done wrong. This is shown by the way that young Charlie still attempts to cover for her beloved uncle even when all the evidence is pointing to him being guilty. Hitchcock has turned this thriller, which could easily have been routine, into a complex study of a family that retains it\\'s interest throughout due to the multiple themes on display.Joseph Cotten was the absolute perfect choice to play uncle Charlie. His portrayal is picture perfect; he carries with him an atmosphere of dread and morbidity throughout, even when he\\'s not doing anything wrong. A role of this sort is difficult to get right, as it\\'s all to easy to underplay it so it isn\\'t effective, or to overstate it so it becomes ridiculous; but Cotten gets the performance spot on. Teresa Wright, who stars alongside Cotten in the role of the other Charlie also does well and delivers a mature and assured performance that fits her character brilliantly. Some of the supporting roles look a little suspect at times, but on the whole the acting from the support is good enough.The ending of the film comes somewhat against the run of play and is maybe a little bit too over the top after the rest of the film, which is largely down to earth. However, it does work and a big ending isn\\'t something I am in the habit of complaining about. This is up there with Hitchcock\\'s best work and therefore is highly recommended.',\n",

I've never been so moved by a story demonstrating the incredible power of innocence and simplicity as performed by Jennifer Jones in this faithful adaptation of the true story of the now-canonized Bernadette Soubirous. Beyond this story, the sets, performances, narrative flow, and in particular, the heavenly-inspired music of Alfred Newman is nothing short of transporting.  Some may find the movie overlong, but I cherished every character and angle to the story--much like enjoying the book with all of its detail.  This effort demonstrates more than just the quality of the golden age of cinema and 20th Century Fox, but it adds a cast and crew clearly inspired to tell this true story like no other has been told before or since.\",\n",

The story of innocent guilt and laughable situations, other movies like What's Up Doc, Marvin's Room, and even Lake Placid (with its moments of ignorance and bliss) have all stolen moments of Arsenic and Old Lace.

       " 'YOU CAN SAFELY READ MY INTRO - NO SPOILERS TO STARTI adore this movie, more every time I watch it.First, just a brief introductory summary to whet your appetite for this great picture (my all time favorite), a vintage black and white film set in Britain during the 1940\\'s... During one of her weekly Thursday shopping excursions in a neighboring town, a rather plain (though earnest and engaging), contentedly married, middle aged housewife named Laura encounters an affable and kind (also married) doctor, Alec, at the train station refreshment counter. Circumstances force a brief interaction and thus begins a series of Thursday meetings between the pair, with casual chance acquaintance quickly replaced by growing and consuming attraction. Most of the scenes revolve around the station tea shop which serves as a sort of \\\\\"home base\\\\\" to the affair. It is Laura\\'s tale; thus the events and emotions are related totally from her point of view, all to the romantic strains of Rachmaninof\\'s Piano Concerto. Read all the other rave reviews about the superb acting / character portrayals, the atmospheric enhancement of the whizzing and hissing trains, and so on. They\\'re all true...plot, character, setting, and atmosphere are all done to perfection in this film. BEWARE - SPOILERS AHEADHowever, if you want a little serious insight into this movie, consider my unique \\\\\"take\\\\\"....Yes, it\\'s dramatically moving and intense, that farewell touch of Alec\\'s hand on Laura\\'s shoulder. However, I\\'m probably one of the only viewers who regards this movie as a tribute to married love, as opposed to the middle aged affair between two ordinary people which is its obvious theme. True, the drama revolves around Laura and Alec, their encounters at the train station, their thwarted passions, and their guilt ridden emotions (especially Laura\\'s). But, let\\'s remember, Laura is narrating the tale as she wishes she could tell it to her husband, Fred, obviously her best friend and \\\\\"the only one who would understand\\\\\".Well, isn\\'t a new romance exciting, the more so if forbidden? Champagne lunches, boat excursions out in the countryside, daydreams of Paris and Venice, hanging on each other\\'s every word. Don\\'t we all sort of yearn for it every now and then? However, if Laura and Alec had remained together, before long they would have resembled...Laura and Fred! The Grand Romance seldom lasts, at least not in its original form; it takes on a more meaningful form. (Failure to realize this of course fills modern divorce courts.) Poor dull Fred! He\\'s my favorite character...I absolutely adore him! He often gets a bad rap from the other reviewers. Don\\'t buy it! Really, there\\'s nothing wrong with him. He probably reminds many a wife of her husband, engrossed with his crossword or whatever. Steady and predictable...the most desirable quality, longterm, in a spouse!Everyone wonders why the movie shows Laura\\'s husband but not Alec\\'s wife, nor does it give us much information about her, other than the fact that she\\'s \\\\\"delicate\\\\\". That\\'s because Brief Encounter is really the story of Laura and FRED. Even though he\\'s not present in that many scenes, his character is well drawn.Fred may not currently be \\\\\"sweeping Laura off her feet\\\\\" but he\\'s actually very kind to her. In the end, he realizes she\\'s been having an affair and is grateful she\\'s chosen him. I categorically disagree with those who claim that Laura returns to her husband only because of society\\'s expectations, not out of love for him.What happens after the movie closes? Well, maybe Fred pays her a tiny bit more attention and, hopefully, some spark of romance might be rekindled. As for Laura, I think she\\'ll be extremely relieved that her affair WASN\\'T consummated, occasionally scold herself for her brief period of insanity, realize the depth of Fred\\'s love, and try to make it up to him for her \\\\\"emotional disloyalty\\\\\". I doubt Laura will spend too much energy bemoaning what she might have had with Alec; the affair has made clearer to her what she DOES have with Fred.It\\'s \\\\\"boring\\\\\" (?), stable, committed love versus brief romance and passion. No movie portrays the contrast better than Brief Encounter. Pity more people today don\\'t make the choice Laura and Alec did. The world might be a better place.This movie puts to shame modern cinema where the main characters are generally in bed within the first five minutes. Don\\'t miss it!',\n",

Robinson is among his best, and often strangely neglected.For me, the essence of noir films has as much to do with the bleak outlook on human existence as it does the visual sense, and at the very beginning of this film, we see (IMHO) the single, most perfect noir moment: Chris Cross (Robinson) is given a dinner, a nice little send off for a nice little man. On his way out, a friend asks if Chris is going to ride the train home, as is his normal pattern. Chris has something on his mind though, and chooses to walk instead.That one single moment, that one choice... and because of that, this man will lose his home, his wife, his career and the very thing that makes him want to continue, his art.

       " 'Starting out, I must advise that my review here is for the 1945 pre-release version of \\\\\"The Big Sleep\\\\\", which had quite a few scenes redone prior to it\\'s release to general audiences in October 1946. With filming already completed by Spring of 1945, there were two main reasons for the year and a half delay; first, with World War II underway, Warner Brothers felt compelled to get it\\'s war related films into theaters while they were still timely. Secondly, Producer/Director Howard Hawks was convinced he had to re-shoot some scenes involving Lauren Bacall, who was critically panned in her latest film, \\\\\"Confidential Agent\\\\\" with Charles Boyer. In the original print, Bacall is presented in a few scenes wearing a distracting veil, and it\\'s her more glamorous side that the studio needed to capitalize on.Much has been made of the complexity of the \\\\\"The Big Sleep\\\\\", and deservedly so. On my latest viewing, I took pen in hand to keep track of the characters and situations. That only helped so much. For example, Humprey Bogart\\'s character, private detective Philip Marlowe is tailing rare book dealer Arthur Gwynne Geiger for his client General Sternwood; Geiger allegedly holds gambling debts involving a few thousand dollars on Sternwood\\'s daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). Following Geiger\\'s auto to his residence, Marlowe studies his surroundings, and then hears a woman\\'s scream and gunshots, followed immediately by two cars careening out of the driveway. Entering the house, he discovers the lifeless body of Geiger, and a spaced out Carmen Sternwood. Out of this scenario are offered two, maybe three possibilities. First, General Sternwood\\'s chauffeur Owen Taylor is implicated, as he had fallen in love with Carmen and wanted to defend her from blackmail. Secondly, a shady Geiger accomplice Joe Brody may have done it, OR may have chased the guilty Taylor from the crime scene either to retrieve some incriminating blackmail film or to remove him as a potential witness. OR, the spaced out Carmen could have killed Geiger herself, and although this wasn\\'t offered as a possibility in the film, she WAS present, and may have been entirely coherent when the murder was committed.And this is how the story proceeds. Even more characters are introduced to spin off the original plot, and Marlowe is off investigating the proprietor of a gambling house named Eddie Mars, Brody\\'s accomplice Agnes Lozier, the salesgirl at the rare bookstore, and Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), a tail on Marlowe who gets rubbed out after setting up a meeting with Agnes that might provide more information to go on.All of the intrigue aside, it\\'s the chemistry once again between Bogey and by now, Mrs. Bogey, Lauren Bacall that propels this movie forward. Whether just sizing each other up at the beginning of the film, or as unwilling accomplices and possible lovers by film\\'s end, it\\'s the snappy banter and smoldering tension between the two that put the sizzle into this edgy noir thriller. As if to prove how great an actor Bogart was, this film offers us a glimpse at his incredible range. Of course I\\'m referring to the bookstore scene in which Bogey portrays a nerdy client seeking information on a non existent rare book. With a mere upturn of his hat\\'s brim and a cleverly positioned pair of glasses, Bogart completely transforms into an almost unrecognizable comic character who befuddles and infuriates the store\\'s proprietress. He follows that up with a walk across the street, and a double entendre filled conversation with a disarmingly seductive Dorothy Malone in a scene that could have lingered into X-rated territory if not for the task at hand.One could go on and on about \\\\\"The Big Sleep\\\\\", and others have, but to appreciate the film\\'s mystery, darkness and noir complexity you\\'ll have to view it. But don\\'t try to solve the case, you won\\'t want to hurt yourself.',\n",

Due to situations like this not enough pressure is put on the movie industry to create decent films. This is why movies like Home alone, and the ring become large grossing movies.',\n",

The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the movie. It hasn\\'t been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence.

Notorious has everything...inimitable Hitchcock moments, mystery, suspense, personal drama, high romance, passion, great character development, international espionage, nuanced acting, a visually stunning foreign locale, post-war period mystique, patriotism, fine supporting cast, a charmingly evil Claude Rains, a most sinister Mme. Konstantin, Grant at his most enigmatic and romantic, and Bergman her most alluring and luminous. As in all great films, it is a spot-on rendering of its own unique story in the ambiance of its own time, but timeless in its portrayal of human character and emotion. Like a handful of others, it is as satisfying a movie experience now as it was 40 years ago...probably more so...whether on first viewing or 40th.',\n",

Hitchcock puts them both in closeups especially the illuminating Bergman, capturing the power of the medium.When Bergman says \\\\\"Oh, you love me-you love me\\\\\" in that wonderful close up I have to think to myself, how much I look forward to becoming a film maker. Why can\\'t Hollywood capture moments like these in today\\'s features?Note how long the kiss lasts as Bergman and Grant move from the balcony to the living room.  The lighting and camera positioning are phenomenal.  Do not expect the typical Hitchcock here but then again it is hard to say what a typical Hitchcock is.  Each of his films contain so many different elements yet, at the same time possess the true signature of an auteur.',\n",

I guess I\\'m just not in the same league as they are because I can watch a movie and be entertained by it. Personally, Notorious (in my uneducated opinion) is perhaps Hitchcock\\'s most tightly knitted story-ever. There is no unnecessary scene, no irrelevant dialog, no padding or fluff. Outstanding acting abounds, intricate camera movements, (the reflection in Alicia\\'s binoculars at the race track, the long camera shot starting at the top of the stairs slowly narrowing in and coming to rest on the key Alicia has secured in her hand, the fragmented images as Alicia realizes she is being poisoned)angles and shadows carry you along effortlessly.Bergman, Grant, and Rains, along with a superb supporting cast bring to the screen the ultimate stylish spy vs. spy yarn. Suspense is slowly built up, and then released throughout; Devlin and Alicia snooping in the wine cellar as the sommelier realizes they need more wine for the party, Devlin finding Alicia confined to her room, and trying to rouse her so he can get her away from the evil in the house are but two examples of the suspense that build to the climax of the film. In a day when we get the likes of Catwoman, American Pie II and Meet The Parents, I\\'ll take the boring and outdated Notorious any day of the week. I\\'m crazy that way.',\n",
       " '\\\\\"Notorious\\\\\" is, of Hitchcock\\'s \\\\\"earlier\\\\\" films, certainly the most durable and endlessly fascinating. Not, God knows, for its \\\\\"brilliant\\\\\" shots -- including the famous tracking shot from the foyer ceiling down to the key in Ingrid Bergman\\'s hand.But for the frank eroticism Hitchcock establishes from the opening party sequence on, and Bergman\\'s breathtakingly uninhibited playing against her \\\\\"virginal\\\\\" type.\\\\\"Notorious\\\\\" is riddled with bad, jerky rear-projection sequences. The first is Bergman\\'s drunken drive along the Florida highway before the policeman stops her.Then, every sequence where she and Cary Grant meet in the park in Rio. Sitting on that bench while the entire world \\\\\"jerks\\\\\" behind them.Pitiful.Do we care? Hell, no.Ingrid Bergman was never so starkly sensual and frank on screen, as she is as \\\\\"Alicia.\\\\\" And Cary Grant, as agent Devlin, was perfectly directed to play cold and largely unresponsive to Bergman\\'s unrestrained and ultimately heartbreaking heat.Grant is given subtle moments early on, to show his falling in love with Bergman. The brief glance he gives her as she leans across his lap in the plane descending into Rio, before Hitchcock quickly fades it out, is almost pornographic (for the era).Their repartee is so fraught with sexual tension and mutual challenge as to be unparalleled in cinema up till that time -- and perhaps even since.Bergman, so powerful an actress, is utterly vulnerable and natural in the early sequences -- emerging from her father\\'s trial with her usual Bergmanesque stoicism, only to instantly become surprisingly, drunkenly, girlish and accessible and dangerous in the next sequence -- brushing windblown hair from her lips as she drives -- viciously fighting off Devlin when she realizes Devlin\\'s an agent -- awakening to a hangover so realistic you can almost smell her breath steaming off the screen -- finally agreeing, out of patriotism, to help the \\\\\"cause.\\\\\" The range of Bergman\\'s performance, from drunken party girl desperate to escape her background, to duplicitous double-agent portraying \\\\\"Madame\\\\\" Sebastian in elegant surroundings, to helplessly, hopelessly lovesick Alicia finally in love with an unresponsive American agent (Grant) -- to an imprisoned woman dying of poisoning -- Bergman is simply brilliant.She was never more sensually presented on screen.Nor was Cary Grant. One does not expect emotional displays or outbursts from a government agent.Grant\\'s / Devlin\\'s professional reluctance to admit, much less act on, his feelings for Bergman\\'s Alicia is evident from frame one. His self-control as an actor and as a man was never better realized. At any moment, he could sexually assault Alicia -- whether out of rage or love is never clear, until the final, tender, moments of the film.By the time Alicia and Devlin reach the infamous two-plus minutes on-off kissing scene in Alicia\\'s Rio apartment, viewers of both sexes are watering at the mouth, wanting them to devour each other.That they don\\'t adds another layer of suspense to what ultimately becomes almost unbearable tension after Alicia weds Sebastian and moves in with him, his mother, and the other Nazis.This is an amazingly daring film in terms of female sexuality, for its day or ours. Hitchcock asks us, as he asks Devlin, to sympathize with -- and love -- a woman who not only sleeps around just as men do, but who is willing to sleep around under false pretenses for the good of her adopted country. If that\\'s a stretch for audiences now, consider what it was for audiences in the late 40s.Is there another \\\\\"heroine\\\\\" in cinema history who blatantly sleeps with a man she despises in order to win the love (and successfully) of another man whom she adores?Name one. Not \\\\\"Mata Hari,\\\\\" who, no matter that she was played by Garbo, had anywhere near the emotional/political/moral complexity of Alicia.We still have to contend with those cheeseball rear-projection sequences. But Bergman and Grant play them so beautifully that the shoddy rear-screen technological primitivism is immediately forgiven.And the secondary casting is so flawless that, in \\\\\"Notorious\\'\\\\\" final sequence, as Claude Rains is called back into the mansion and walks up those steps to his inevitable death, and the door closes while Bergman and Grant escape to a new life, our feelings are a mixture of triumph and pity.Truly, one of Hitchcock\\'s most complex, sexually challenging, political, adult, ambiguous and disturbing films.Forget the cheeseball rear-projections, please.\\\\\"Notorious\\\\\" is several glasses -- perhaps too many -- of vintage cinematic champagne.Good grief!',\n",

       " 'Bogart made three unforgettable landmark films: Maltese Falcon, Big Sleep, and Dark Passage. Of the three, Dark Passage is the least known, which is tragic, because it measures up to the other three and in many ways surpasses them for atmosphere, characterization and psychological mood. Based on a novel by David Goodis, who also wrote the novel that Shoot The Piano Player was based on, it hits top marks in rankings of films in the categories of Film Noir, Existentialism, Dostoyevskian outlook and Kafkan world-view. Filled with forever unforgettable scenes and quotable lines, heart-wrenching views of fog-bound 1940s San Francisco and characters who seem to be stand-ins for the all our own private inauspicious never-to-be famous or successful friends and acquaintances, it\\'s a brilliant metaphor for that dying species: the \\\\\"individual\\\\\".

       " \"As one of the most emotionally shaded, unforgettable instalments of the noir cycle, Jacques Tourneur's Out Of The Past opens deceptively \\\\u0096 not in the neon-lit tenderloin of a big city some rainy night but up in the thin, cool air of the High Sierras, in a little town whose Main and only street boasts an open-kitchen beanery on one side and a gas station on the other.  The sign on the station tells that it belongs to Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum), and when a stranger drops into the diner looking for his old pal Bailey, the waitress remarks `Small world.' `Or big sign,' the out-of-towner cryptically replies. \\\\nOf course it's not a casual call to catch up on times past, because Mitchum has a past, a heavy one that's about to catch up with him, a past that he lived under another name.   The visitor to the mountains is an emissary from silky operator Kirk Douglas, for whom Mitchum, with his partner in the private-eye racket Steve Brodie, has worked before, with fateful results. Mitchum senses that his particular jig may be up, and, before answering his summons from Douglas to meet him at Lake Tahoe, tells his story, in flashback, to his girl (Virgina Huston).A woman (Jane Greer) had shot Douglas and absconded with his $40,000. Douglas engaged Mitchum to play bounty-hunter, to track her down and bring her and the loot back.  His search led him to Mexico and a little bar called La Mar Azul, where she appeared `out of the sunlight,' elusive but radiant, and stole his heart.  A few days later she reappeared, this time `out of the moonlight,' and under that subtropical moon they walked on the beach and then to her cozy bungalow, where a sudden deluge drenched them to the skin and blew open the door to their passion.  Here, Tourneur establishes himself as the Great Romantic of the noir cycle \\\\u0096 it's a charged and rapturous idyll.  But even illicit honeymoons must end.  Greer and Mitchum came back to the States, lying low in the North Beach district of San Francisco, until the industrious Brodie, in Douglas' pocket, spotted them at a racetrack.  They lay even lower, thinking they've finally eluded him, but he turned up one night at their mountain cabin, where Greer coldly shot him dead.  Even more startled than Brodie was Mitchum, who saw Greer in a new light that neither sun nor moon provided \\\\u0096 with the wrenching realization that she wasn't the innocent victim of bad men and worse circumstances that she'd sold herself to him as.  She clinched the point by high-tailing off, leaving him to dispose of the body (and forgetfully leaving her bankbook, showing a deposit of the $40-grand that she'd lied about never taking). \\\\nSo much for the past; the present now beckons, as does Douglas.  He claims to harbor no ill will for Mitchum.  And why should he?  As Mitchum joins him for breakfast on the terrace, Greer is  there, too, eating grapefruit as though nothing had happened.  The past holds no claims on her; she lives the for next advantage the future can offer.  But Douglas has a job for Mitchum, involving a shady lawyer and some compromising papers back in San Francisco.Here the movie takes its most audacious turn (Daniel Mainwaring wrote the script from his novel Build My Gallows High \\\\u0096 as Geoffrey Homes \\\\u0096 and James M. Cain and Frank Fenton had their hands in it as well).  Right in the middle of Out Of The Past we embark on something close to a movie-within-a-movie, a mini-Maltese Falcon, with a new set of characters and even a new femme fatale (Rhonda Fleming).  The conventional look of film noir \\\\u0096 taxicabs and elevators, penthouse apartments at night with the Coit Tower looming in the distance \\\\u0096 finally gets full rein.  But then into this murky scheme \\\\u0096 a frame-up, really \\\\u0096 emerges Greer, this time out of pitch darkness.  The plots within plots begin to converge....Out Of The Past was a pivotal picture for its three principals.  It was only Douglas' second film, but he started big \\\\u0096 in a supporting role but a meaty one, as in his debut the previous year in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (they're two of the best roles he would ever take).  Mitchum had spent years in the galleys but finally got a leading role that let him unleash his distinctive persona \\\\u0096 the fearless and nimble intelligence behind the nonchalant eyes, the world-weary retorts mumbled from behind the cigarette drooping from his lip (it's Mitchum's own appropriation of what Humphrey Bogart had started).  The best of his many great lines he aims at Greer, calling her a `leaf that the wind blows from gutter to gutter.'   And Greer, who made far fewer movies than her acting (graceful and natural) and her looks (like a less literal Jayne Meadows) would augur, takes her most emblematic credit and plays it to the hilt.  Hers is perhaps the slowest transformation in the noir cycle and the most breathtakingly brutal.  When, for her final scene, she shows up in a snood, it's clear that, for Mitchum, good times are no longer in store.The talent that went into Out Of The Past is manifold.  Both director of photography Nicholas Musuraca and Roy Webb, who wrote the responsive score, were old comrades of Tourneur from his earlier days in Val Lewton's B-movie unit at RKO.  The credentials for the screenplay, as above, were impeccable, resulting in chiseled, quotable dialogue, right down to Paul Valentine (as one of Douglas' strong-arms) advising Greer, about to place a long-distance call, that `those dames listen in.'  But the most prestigious palm must go to Tourneur.  He had less of a distinctive style to him \\\\u0096 less of a `look,' less of a formula \\\\u0096 than most of the top-flight noir directors; he was a chameleon, who used his talents less to make his own statement as to bring out the best in the scripts he was given.  He was born in France and he died in France, but when in Hollywood he brought neither technical innovation nor rigorous theory to his work.  Rather he looked for the human element that underlies and informs art \\\\u0096 and he relished its complexity. (The movie, for instance, opens and closes on Dickie Moore, as a teenaged deaf mute in Mitchum's employ, and whose function in the story is far from a merely sentimental fillip.)  Tourneur took film noir as close to tragic poetry as it would ever come, and Out Of The Past, his masterwork, raised the standards of the noir cycle as far as they would ever go.  It's not just one of the greatest noirs, it's one of the greatest movies, period.\",\n",

The man, as played by the extraordinary Ralph Richardson, is a mass of contradictions and yet we understand him. Married to a shrew and in love with Michele Morgan no less. Carol Reed is not a director that comes immediately to mind when one lists the greatest directors of all time, but in my book, is right up there with the very best. No other director has been able to bring Graham Green to the screen with its spirit so gloriously intact. Guilt and fear as riveting entertainment. Suspenseful, funny and beautiful to look at.

       " \"My favorite Bogart movie is also Key Largo. Even before Edward G. Robinson and his hoods take everyone hostage in Lionel Barrymore's hotel there is a tension that does not let up for one second. Movie goers had to be on the edge of their seats in 1948.There is one scene however that I don't think viewers today can fully appreciate. Lionel Barrymore had been acting from a wheelchair for 10 years and movie audiences were used to that. When Robinson and his goons goad him to a futile gesture of bravado, Barrymore rises from that chair and moves slowly towards the snickering Robinson. He swings and misses and falls down and Bogey and Bacall pick up Barrymore and bring him back to his wheelchair. The shock value of that scene for 1948 audiences would have a dimension that can't be appreciated now.Robinson's Johnny Rocco is based on Lucky Luciano who had been deported a few years back. He's evil incarnate and Humphrey Bogart as Frank McCloud is the jaded, cynical former idealist who redeems himself and becomes the countervailing force for good. They play well against each other in a reverse from the 1930s Warner gangster flicks where Robinson was usually the good guy.Who could have known this would be the fourth, last, and best of the Bogey and Bacall teamings.\",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t get me wrong, I have nothing against Lord of the Rings and I respect people\\'s right to obsess over whatever they wish. Nonetheless, it does often irritate the cynic in me that we\\'re teaching a generation of kids that there is a distinct borderline between \\'good\\' and \\'evil\\', between \\'justice\\' and \\'injustice\\', that there exists such a thing as a \\'hero\\', when in reality there is actually nothing of the sort.Ladri di Biciclette is a shining example of a film that demonstrates this fact. There is no distinction between the \\'good guys\\' and the \\'bad guys\\'. At times we support one character, or the others. But there is never a line drawn between one side or the other because in reality, the only people we see here are simply human - flawed, corruptible and in this case, all suffering the same tragic fate. Our central character Antonio is obviously the protagonist, and he is obviously portrayed in such a way that our sympathies lie with him, but he is far from being a hero. He is simply used as the representation of the tragic misfortune that can befall mankind. This misfortune, also, is not depicted in any black-and-white sense. Antonio and his family\\'s plight is not the only, or even necessarily the most desperate, in this film. In fact, with the exception of the family in the restaurant scene, practically every single character, major or minor, is portrayed as suffering in some way at the hands of capitalism.Therefore, as obviously tragic as Antonio\\'s story is, the only real reason we side with him is because his particular tragedy is centrally focused. But, as has been discussed so often previously, he is an Everyman character. The bicycle in the film is simply used as an analogy for the loss, or lack of any essential element of life that leads to poverty and suffering. In very simple terms, the film\\'s message is essentially that at some stage in life, we are all shouting \\\\\"Give me back my bicycle!\\\\\" But I digress. This simplistic and amateurish film is far more real and far more true-to-life than practically anything that Hollywood has churned out in the past fifty years. For that reason, the realist in me believes that all those dreamers, people who believe in a happy ending or ideal status quo, could do with the sort of down-to-earth lesson that this film represents.Yes, it\\'s a distressing and bleak vision. But nevertheless, an utterly profound one.',\n",
       " 'Max Ophuls was an exceptionally good director, best recalled for \\\\\"Le Ronde\\\\\", \\\\\"The Earings of Madame D\\\\\", \\\\\"Lola Montez\\\\\", and this film - his best Hollywood movie. He could capture the charm of the Europe of the 19th Century but he was realistic enough to admit two things: the social system was hardly fair with it\\'s layers of classes and their appointed rankings, and love was glorious, but ephemeral. It is hard to select his best movie, but once you see any you can\\'t forget them. I personally like \\\\\"Letter From An Unknown Woman\\\\\" more than \\\\\"Le Ronde\\\\\" and \\\\\"Lola Montez\\\\\", but I feel that both of the others are certainly worth watching and watching again.The film follows Louis Jourdan\\'s last night alive. You don\\'t realize this while the film goes on, but it is centered on that. A philanderer who has wasted a promising career as a concert pianist (he is an unsuccessful version of Franz Liszt, who also had many love affairs - including one with Lola Montez), he has received a challenge to a duel from the husband of one. Actually it turns out this is the Austrian Baron (Marcel Journet) who was married to Joan Fontaine, and (although it does not immediately register) the husband and his second are seen at the start of the film watching Jourdan\\'s apartment. Jourdan has returned home to quickly pack a bag, in order to flee the outraged husband - as he has probably has done many times - but he would not have had a real chance.Jourdan is interrupted by his silent servant (Art Smith) who hands him a letter. It is the last letter ever written by Fontaine, and it details her lifelong adoration and love for Jourdan, which was met by him only once or twice in all these years - once when they spent the night together in an amusement park, and once when they met years later, when she had gotten married. Jourdan was always charming and intense, but he was always looking for the immediate gratification of his sexual desires. Fontaine, of course, hoped for a lifetime\\'s satisfaction. She has had a son by Jourdan, and it led to some economic difficulties, but Journet (whom she knew as a military cadet) has always loved her and is willing to accept her and the boy as his own. Part of the tragedy of the story is that the Austrian Baron\\'s decency can\\'t make headway against Fontaine\\'s fatal fascination with this pianist. The boy dies from an illness he accidentally gets on a railway trip. Fontaine dies from the same illness while trying to care for the boy, but lives long enough to write her letter. With full irony, after the shattering experience of learning he was this loved and had a son, and had thoughtlessly thrown both away, Jordan still does not know Fontaine\\'s name. Art Smith\\'s character, the loyal servant, has no lines. This may be due to his pronounced American voice (see his performances in \\\\\"In A Lonely Place\\\\\" and \\\\\"Ride The Pink Horse\\\\\" to hear his voice), but it makes his quiet, kindly role all the more effective as a representative of either conscience or humanity. Jordan asks what Fontaine\\'s name was, and Smith writes it down and gives it to him. It is now daybreak, and Jordan can turn coward and run (supposedly - don\\'t forget Journet is downstairs watching), or bravely go to the field of honor and die. He chooses the latter to be united with his family.It is a wonderful film with lovely touches: the fake railway journey in the amusement park, and the musician\\'s coffee club in Vienna are two of them. It is a lovely film, and one of the most tragic to watch. I can easily recommend it.',\n",

Great actors give perfect performances in Hitchcok films. Think of Grant and Bergman in Notorious, Cotten in Shadow Of A Doubt not to mention Anthony Perkins in Psycho.

But -- he doesn\\'t know how to read big words!So Curtin takes the letter and reads it. It\\'s not just a directorial flash in the pan, because the scene resonates at the end of the movie when Curtin rides off to meet Cody\\'s wife in the blossom-blooming peach orchard. What I mean is that the letter-reading scene is there for a larger purpose than simply adding to our appreciation of the characters at that particular moment. The fight with Pat in the cantina. Absolutely nothing happens the way it had always happened in previous movies. Huston stages it in a way that an artist would think of. In all movies before this one, fights involved (1) a general melee in which no one wins or loses, or (2) one clip on the jaw and the guy is unconscious. Here, MacCormack, the heavy, done very nicely by Barton Maclaine, abruptly bashes one guy over the head with a bottle of booze and socks the other one. Both victims crumple. But somebody grabs Pat\\'s legs as he walks towards the door. More blows. Bodies slump to the floor and they have a hell of a time getting back up on their feet. More blows. Pat is finally beaten to the floor and he\\'s not unconscious. \\\\\"Okay. Enough, fellas. I\\'m beat.

Anybody who\\'s ever served in an infantry unit will tell you that for all the bickering back and forth, members of a squad, platoon, or company will always look out for each other. \\\\\"Battleground\\\\\" captures this perfectly.One of the saddest things for me about this movie is how few people know of it.

       " 'Undoubtedly one of the most perfect, brilliant comedies ever, this movie is extremely fun and revels in its dark, clever humour. What can one say about a comedy centred around a dapper, charming, likable, impoverished young English gentleman who is at the same time an utterly remorseless, ever-calculating killer who has no qualms about killing an entire line of relatives who all stand in his path to inherit the family fortune? On top of that, he all the while takes great care in preserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman; all the relatives he must eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness; and there\\'s an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to his social \\\\\"superior.\\\\\" The dialogue, indeed pretty much all of the humour, is a shining example of \\\\\"British humour\\\\\" at its best. It is subtle, clever, dark, and full of irony and satire. It is pure, brilliant entertainment that doesn\\'t stop. Comedy really can\\'t get much better than this.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t know why this movie always hooks me the way it does; it\\'s obviously a masterpiece and a revered piece of British/American cinema - but that alone is not the reason (there are other such masterpieces which fail to have that effect on me). Maybe it\\'s the setting: the beautiful city of Vienna right after World War II, the scars of the most devastating conflict in human history still visible at every corner. Or it\\'s the contrast between the eerily happy music tune - which plays throughout the entire film - and the dark, tragic story of murder and betrayal which I find so strangely captivating. Whatever it is, I just love this movie.\\'The Third Man\\' now has more than 60 years on its back, but its age hardly shows. Despite the story\\'s dark themes, the general mood of the narrative is rather light, sometimes darkly funny, and the slightly cynical tone and morally ambiguous characters give the movie a very modern feel. What also stands out and makes the film memorable - in addition to the fantastic soundtrack - is the outstanding, Accademy Award winning cinematography. Black and white has rarely looked better. The way DOP Robert Krasker plays with unusual angles and virtually \\\\\"paints\\\\\" this city of Vienna with light and shadow, he adds an almost expressionistic quality to the film. I always felt that the city plays an essential part in the story, - a key character if you will - with its damaged buildings reflecting the damaged human characters. The recent war is a looming presence throughout the film, and to me this is as much a story about the desensitizing effect of war on people as it is a murder mystery. And there is yet another quality to the film which needs to be mentioned: it\\'s very entertaining. \\'The Third Man\\' has fantastic pacing and there is simply not a dull moment in it. To sum up my overall impressions, this is one of those rare occasions where everything just falls right into place and helps create a unique film experience: Carol Reed\\'s masterful direction and the wonderful performances by the fantastic actors (Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli and Orson Welles); the beautiful soundtrack by Anton Karas; the gorgeous cinematography by Robert Krasker, and, perhaps most importantly, the story and screenplay by Graham Greene with its unexpected twists and turns (although the unusual, iconic ending wasn\\'t Greene\\'s idea).

       " \"This fabulous work was years and years ahead of its time when it was made in 1950, being a work of art that engages the eyes and the ears, but most essentially, the brain. The film is both aesthetically beautiful, using amazing camera techniques, extensive periods of silence and a very limited cast to deliver the action, and the story is typically Japanese...ostensibly amazingly simple, but complex to the point of sending you cross-eyed!The basic tale is this: a woman and her husband, a Samurai, are travelling through a forest when they meet a bandit. The bandit has sex with the woman and the Samurai ends up dead. That's it. This tale is related to us through the woodcutter and a monk who saw the protagonists give their evidence to the police (the dead Samurai through a medium), but unfortunately the three tales conflict with one another. Each confessor says that they killed the Samurai, and then we hear from the woodcutter who in fact witnessed the event, who gives us a version of events that borrows from each individual account, and is still less credible!The conclusion presented by Kurosawa seems to be firstly that individuals see things from different perspectives, but secondly, and most importantly, that there is no objective truth. There is no answer as to what took place in the forest, and Kurosawa offers us no way of knowing what went on. Each story is as credible as the other, and so no conclusion about guilt can be reached. We even have to think at the end that as the whole thing is reported to us by the woodcutter and priest, was there any truth in anything we heard at all?This film leads to an especially tricky conclusion for a movie-goer! Your eyes are supposed to show you objective truth, but they don't. The camera is supposed not to lie, but it does. I feel that the simple message is that subjectivity lies at the heart of life, and this subjectivity needs to be recognised before any attempt is made to understand events.\",\n",
       " 'The more I watch and re-watch Kurosawa\\'s films, the more I am sure that he will be remembered as the greatest director of the 20th century. Although I prefer \\\\\"Ran\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Seven Samurai\\\\\" for reasons of personal taste, I don\\'t think I would argue very much with anyone who proposed that \\\\\"Rashomon\\\\\" was his best film. Made in 1950, it is so unusual and so far ahead of it\\'s time that it takes your breath away.The story itself deserves a mention: A husband &amp; wife travelling through woods are attacked by a thief, who ties up the husband and rapes the wife. This is as much of the story as we can be sure of. The husband ends up dead of a stab wound. How did he die? Who was responsible? Each of the three give their accounts before a court (the dead husband through a medium!), and each account is entirely different. A woodcutter who witnessed the events gives a fourth, entirely different, account.Each flashback is an absolute gem in itself, and lives long in the mind. Toshiro Mifune as the thief exudes more raw masculinity and charisma that I think I have ever seen in ANY movie, and creates a totally believeable character. Machiko Kyo as the wife is superb in what are essentially four different roles, her own version being the highlight. The husband\\'s character is the least well developed, but since he spends a lot of the time either tied up or dead, that\\'s not really surprising.Because the viewer knows that each flashback is highly personal to the teller, a vast amount of brainpower and concentration are required if you are going to try to work out what actually DID happen. Alternatively, watch the film twice back-to-back, once for the visuals and acting, and once for the detective work and philosophical implications.My favourite shot in the movie is one which starts with the husband and wife kneeling, facing each other, a view of the wife over the shoulder of the husband; the camera then moves round to the side and simultaneously zooms in on the wife\\'s profile; then pulls back behind the wife, ending with a view of the husband\\'s face over the shoulder of the wife - a mirror image of the initial shot in the sequence. Absolutely awesome! And dating from 1950! Unbelievable!I normally try to keep my reviews a LOT shorter than this, but I make no apologies in this case. Indeed, there are lots of other points I would like to make (I haven\\'t even mentioned the central importance of the dagger, or the relevance of the Rashomon gate itself). I could go on and on and on... however, a better use of your time would be to seek out and watch this film...NOW!',\n",
       " 'It is, according to me, a very bad movie.  I was quite surprised to see that Rashomon was a horrible film, since everyone says that it is a great one. I was especially hit hearing the worst sound track.  I really think that Kurosawa was not interested in music at all.  And Rashomon is too much long. I have read the short story by Akutagawa(which is great), which is about 20 pages.  Consequently, I do not understand why the film lasts so long. So I do not say that it is an awful movie, but I don\\'t think that it is worth calling \\\\\"the best movie in the world\\\\\".  I do not want to forbid to see the movie, since it is still interesting, but think by yourself before saying that it is super, as almost everybody say.',\n",

I do not usually like Marlene Dietrich, but I have to admit that she did a splendid job as the flamboyant theater star. This movie is set in London, and Hitchcock did a wonderful job of picking out the crew\\'s British actors and actresses such as Alistair Sim and Michael Wilding.

I don\\'t know if the black &amp; white was an economic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of Joe Gillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond.

For those that lived through WWII in that country it must have seemed as if those days were repeating themselves. Every detail of this movie is accurate as far as I could tell.

In \\\\\"A Place on the Sun\\\\\" an Elizabeth Taylor barely out of her teens is paired with Montgomery Clift. She had been raised at MGM and groomed for movie stardom from day one. He was a method actor, complex, introspective and their coupling produced something that I\\'m tempted to call, unrepeatable. The actors own personal stories, their friendship, mutual love and respect made it possible for their communion to be so transcendental.

       " 'I had put off watching this video for sometime.  I was afraid that I might be disappointed in this classic.  Instead I was drawn into this marvelous film with its great Tennesse Williams\\' script.Williams doesn\\'t let any of his characters off.  Brando\\'s Stanley is a boorish, bullying, loudmouth.  But he also possesses an extraordinary physical sexuality and also seems to be more than a little bit of a victim himself.  Life has not been smooth for Stanley.  No silver spoon here. Both his wife and sister-in-law put him down as a crude \\\\\"Polack\\\\\" and other variations on that theme.  Not that there isn\\'t some obvious truth to their put downs.  However, truly nice people (as opposed to \\\\\"nice\\\\\" people) do not engage in such speech.  There\\'s also the table scene where Stanley is eating chicken and receives a harsh verbal reprimand from Stella.  Whereupon he sees the tactics of class shame being used and he proceeds to blow up in a very physical and blue collar fashion.  Stanley sexually assaults Blanche at he end of the film.  Blanche was already hearing voices by this time in the film, and this act of aggression pushes her over the edge.  Brando\\'s performance was really superb.Hunter\\'s Stella is by far the most likeable character of the major 3 players.  She\\'s honest, kind, sexy, and very much in love with Stanley--despite his obvious faults.  The depiction of the physical love and lust between Stanley and Stella is classic.  She also loves her sister and wants what\\'s best for her.  She and Blanche collude to some extent against Stanley which provides much of the film\\'s strongest tensions.  Stella is financially and sexually/emotionally dependent on Stanley, but she\\'s also a strong character in her own right.  We don\\'t really know for sure if she\\'ll go back to Stanley at the end of the film after the baby and the sexual aggression against Blanche.  We do know that Stanley for all his macho swagger is extremely emotionally dependent on her.Vivien Leigh\\'s character was a revelation. I thought the most brilliant moments in the film were towards the end when her character was speaking. I didn\\'t really think Leigh\\'s accent was all that great, but hey, when you can act like that who cares?  Blanche is a victim, but Blanche is anything but innocent.  She was having sex with one of her high school English lit students back in Mississippi.  Naturally, the small town locals did not take a shine to such behavior.  Also, she was more than just a bit on the promiscuous side for a high school teacher in mid-century small town America.  It\\'s not surprising that she got chased out of her small town teaching job.  There\\'s also the touching scene where she asks for and gets a kiss from the boy who is collecting for the newspaper.  It\\'s all tied in to her love for the boy who killed himself over her when she was 16. She said some very cruel words to him about being weak which led to the boy\\'s suicide.  She\\'s not an innocent--by any means.  The sexual attraction between Stanley and her is noticeable in a number of scenes.  And yet for all her pretentiousness, lies, and putting on airs, the audience is drawn to her.  Her fading beauty, vulnerability, and weakness can hardly help but elicit a sympathetic response.  Blanche is the human condition writ large. In some respects there is some of Blanche in all of us:  hidden ugliness from the past, both emotional and sexual neediness, and just plain old human weakness.  I think Leigh\\'s performance was really brilliant.  And thank God for Tennnessee Williams and his ability to portray people more as we are than as we would like to be.I do agree with at least one of the previous viewers that the term \\\\\"nymphomaniac\\\\\" seems somewhat out-of-date in describing Blanche.  Blanche uses sex in a promiscuous fashion to escape from her loneliness.  I think this is the same pathology that both men and women engage in when having \\\\\"casual--such a strange contradiction in terms--sex\\\\\".  I certainly don\\'t think that Williams saw her as either a \\\\\"nympho\\\\\" or a \\\\\"slut\\\\\".  Rather, just a lonely, tortured individual.',\n",
       " \"There is little to be said about this movie that thousands of critics have not stated already. It is a magnificent piece of cinema, with an intricate script delivered by actors at the peak of their talents. Leigh is unbearably brittle and fragile and she dances precariously on the edge of sanity. Marlon Brando embodies a sense of brooding masculinity that other men can only dream of attaining, while creating an enduring cinema icon and delivering one of the all-time great movie lines. From the raucous jazz score to the sleazy production design bathed in smoldering grey, 'Streetcar' is a class-act from beginning to end; sexy, brutal, and endlessly fascinating.\",\n",

The plot, the performances, the brutal series of events leading up to the final show down gun fights all contribute to a feeling one has that it truly is noon day with a relentless sun beating down. This is a Western which almost makes one smell the dust of the town streets. The sheer masculinity of Marshall Kane is beautifully balanced with superb feminine grace and strength found in Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado. Ian MacDonald's Frank Miller comes across as a villain par excellence. This is a perfect presentation for black and white. Color would have diminished the sense of impending death that builds relentlessly with each coward's refusal to help Marshal Kane. The film emphasizes that triumph often comes with a price.

Watching this movie for so many years, since I was a child, the story still hasn't lost it's touch. It's such a wonderful movie that not only the family could get into, but even I'll just watch it on my own if I want a cute movie. This is one of the best Disney movies of all time and the story of Peter Pan is told so wonderful you can't help but fall in love with it as well.In London, George and Mary Darling's preparations to attend a party are disrupted by the antics of the boys John and Michael, acting out a story about Peter Pan and the pirates, told to them by their older sister Wendy. The father angrily declares that Wendy has gotten too old to continue staying in the nursery with them, and it's time for her to grow up. That night they are visited in the nursery by a pixie named Tinker Bell and cocky Peter Pan, who teaches them to fly and takes them with him to the island of Never Land. A ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land, commanded by Captain Hook with his sidekick Mr Smee. Hook boldly plots to take revenge upon Peter Pan for cutting off his hand, but he trembles when the crocodile that ate it arrives. The crew's restlessness is interrupted by the arrival of Peter and the Darlings. The children easily evade them, and despite a trick by jealous Tinker Bell to have Wendy killed, they meet up with the Lost Boys, six lads in animal-costume pajamas who look to Peter as their leader. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's Indians, who instead capture them, believing them responsible for taking the chief's daughter Tiger Lily. Meanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the mermaids, where they see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily, to coerce her into revealing Peter's hideout. Peter and Wendy free her, and Peter is honored by the tribe. Hook then plots to take advantage of Tink's jealousy of Wendy, tricking her into revealing the location of Peter's lair. The pirates lie in wait and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit, leaving behind a time bomb to kill Peter. I'm always going to love Peter Pan, my sister and I still have so much fun with this movie, we constantly rehearse the scene of George, the father, screaming about how the family loves the dog more than him, it's a great scene. But still one scene that always gets me rolling on the floor laughing is when Peter Pan tells Captain Hook to scream in front of his crew and Peter's lost boys that he's a codfish, and you see everyone just cheer and make fun of Captain Hook as well as that blasted crocodile that won't leave him alone. This is such a great movie, if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, it's a fun film to watch and will always hold a great place in my heart. 10/10\",\n",

       " 'A completely novel plot.  Happened upon this on late night TV about 10 years ago.  Thought I had seen all the best of the classics and then this came on.  \\\\\"Where have you been all my life?\\\\\" was the overwhelming question.  What an incredibly beautiful and stark movie at the same time.  Absolutely unprecedented.  Everything about it--especially the cinematography (check out the scene with the turnabout for the trucks) is superior.  If you care about plot, allegory, intelligent directing and acting, this is one which is second to none.

       " 'Film lovers with a slightly more than rudimentary knowledge of the subject recognize that Ingmar Bergman was active long before he directed The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries. Still, few of those earlier films are known that well, besides perhaps Smiles of a Summer\\'s Night (which I don\\'t care for much myself, though I owe it a reassessment). In 1953 Bergman made two of his greatest works, Sawdust and Tinsel and Summer with Monika (distributed in the US as simply \\\\\"Monika,\\\\\" but I prefer to use the entire title, as it just sounds better). Sawdust and Tinsel, as I say, is another masterwork; do see it. But it is not the issue at hand here. Summer with Monika has a classic art film story behind it: Bergman came up with the idea quickly, having gotten some money, and he just took his few actors and crew on a summer vacation with very little planning involved. What results is a simple story, but one that is very mature and emotionally complex. Two teenage lovers escape the tyranny of their parents. Stealing a boat, they travel around the southern islands of Sweden together, revelling in their adolescent lust. A few things happen along the way, but they aren\\'t really worth mentioning. Not that these events are unimportant, only that to describe them would not be useful here; they ought to be experienced as they happen.What makes this film a masterpiece is the third act. Teenage love is often so idealized by artists, born from an air of irresistable nostalgia. Maybe Ingmar Bergman was too much of a pessimist for his characters to find neverending happiness by the time the film fades out. Harriet Andersson, a Bergman regular, of course, plays Monika. There is a love in her, and she may even really love Harry (played by Lars Ekborg) when they set out together. On the other hand, part of it is she just wants the experience of an adventure, of independence from her cluttered and sad homelife and parents, of love, and, not least of all, of sex. Monika is, first and foremost, a sexual being. Andersson is not exploited, though, as she so easily could have been (French actress Brigitte Bardot provides the best example of just how an actress\\' career can be harmed by these kinds of highly sexual roles). Andersson arouses the audience, but Bergman is careful (as he is with all of his women) not to make her into some cheap male fantasy. We want Harriet Andersson, yet we realize that she is not to be had. She is her own person.This manifests itself in a pretty nasty way in the third act. Eventually, as the summer begins to fade, Harry decides that the two of them cannot spend the rest of their lives drifting around on a boat. They also have realized that Monika has become pregnant. Bergman thus eschews the type of ending where the two return home, maybe in love maybe not, and that\\'s that. Instead, he gives these two characters a reality check. Harry jumps into it with gusto, marrying his sweetheart and getting a decent job. When his child is born, he is overjoyed. Unfortunately, Monika (who is two years younger than Harry, at 17) cannot make the same leap. This monotonous, routine life which she was hoping to escape falls back down on her. The fact that she has a child annoys her: no longer is she free to do what she chooses. And her lust is now left unsatisfied: Harry sees her as the beautiful mother of his child, not so much as his lover anymore. Ultimately, because Harry is away so much with his work, Monika\\'s lust breaks loose. In the film\\'s most memorable scene, she picks up a new boyfriend at a bar. Bergman allows her to look straight into the camera, one of the earliest examples of a filmmaker breaking the fourth wall. Monika looks into our eyes, and we see the pain, fear, and loneliness she has acquired. The shot is held for what seems like forever, even though it comprises only a few seconds.\\\\nMonika leaves Harry and their baby. The film ends with Harry alone, staring at himself and his child in the mirror. He is hurt, that is certain, but I do not believe that he judges her too harshly. After all, he does understand Monika and her temperament. As he remembers the beauty of the summer he and Monika shared, he cradles in his arm the only physical evidence left of that time. It\\'s a sad ending, but, with the warmness we see in Harry\\'s expression, we know that the child will be much loved by its father. Life continues.',\n",

Jose Ferrer and Fred MacMurray are superb, and indeed so is the entire cast, but the film clearly belongs to Humphrey Bogart's Captain Queeg. It's a real treat to see 'Bogie' in a film where he isn't a gangster or a romantic with a gruff exterior. Bogart spectacularly conveys the sheer complexity of his character: the quirks, the devotion to duty, the demand for perfection, the refusal to accept his own fallibility.

       " 'Hitchcock must have forever wondered how he managed to allow this story to slip out of his hands, but the fact remains: had he filmed CELLE QUI N\\'ETAIT PAS into his own version of what is known as LES DIABOLIQUES, there very well might not have been a VERTIGO, also an adaptation from the authors of the aforementioned one and D\\'ENTRE LES MORTES. All in all, this is an excellent horror film that has strong Film Noir overtones and precedes New Wave by a couple of years and its simple yet powerful direction by Jean Georges-Clouzot elevates it from a standard thriller to one to which all others are measured spawning countless imitations with much less satisfying degree. One wonders what treatment Hitchcock would have given it, and interestingly, it\\'s all here: the almost casual presentation of spousal abuse that occurs off-camera in one chilling scene early on, the events that lead the women (Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret) to make a drastic decision concerning killing Clouzot\\'s husband (Michel DelaSalle), and then the growing, deadly certainty he may not be quite dead after all... and may be after the terrified women. The last 15 minutes are one of the most tension-inducing I\\'ve ever seen in any climactic montage (even if it does veer into a certain implausibility but the intent is to tell a suspense story and Hitchcock has often mentioned the \\\\\"suspension of disbelief\\\\\" factor) and have long gone into history as one of the most horrific moments in cinema.To those interested in watching LES DIABOLIQUES, please do NOT watch its American remake, DIABOLIQUE, with Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. It pays to read the subtitles in this film.',\n",
       " \"I had forgotten that most if not all of it happens in one single room. The planning of it is a display of extraordinary craftsmanship. Not a lagging moment. I was riveted to the, let's face it, preposterous plot from beginning to end. Ray Milland is a credible monster in elegant and civilized clothing. Grace Kelly, a peach as the unfaithful wife who stays home to cut newspaper clippings of her husband's past glories. Yeah, right. Robert Cummings has always been a mystery to me. A popular leading man with a long career. He only exudes a campy, if lightweight vibe that almost works in comedies and when he's in a supporting role - My Geisha and What A Way To Go with Shirley MacLaine are good examples. Here as Grace Kelly's secret lover, I don't know what to say. John Williams. very funny again as the Scotland Yard inspector, the same character to a T he played in Midnight Lace with Doris Day or was it his twin brother?

       " \"Great cast and stunning direction makes this an offbeat classic.  Funny interpretation of gender roles in America -- Crawford as the emasculated nihilistic prostitute/businesswoman, and Hayden (in PERFECT casting) as a slightly pretty-boy gunslinger, a role in which he is as passive to Crawford as a typical film heroine to her hero.  All bit parts are memorable, particularly the venomous McCambridge (one of her best characterizations -- it makes my skin crawl every time I see her face light up as they burn the casino) and John Carradine's memorably pathetic death scene.\\\\nA lot of people have said a lot of things about this movie.  I was glad to see from glancing through the postings on IMDB that there is also some healthy discussion of the movie on here -- how much it means, how little it means.  I don't think it was designed to save the world from its madness, nor do I think it's a lesbian love story (although there is some strange element in McCambridge's obsessive hatred of Crawford), but I do think there's something going on beneath the surface of this film that's hard to explain.  Somehow, it ended up being much much better than it should have been.  One thing is, I think Nick Ray and Phil Yordan decided the story was so ridiculous that they would just concentrate on the emotional elements, also bringing out the pure fantasy (going behind the waterfall to find a hidden fortress, the heroine running from the fire in her white satin dress, etc.) that is the best element of all great film.  But it's really hard to pin down any one element that makes it great, so I'll have to stand pat and just say it's a combination of elements that are operating on conscious and subconscious levels to bring about a fantastic movie experience -- to those who are able to surrender to it.One other element worthy of comment -- the wonderful opening sequence where Hayden rides through a hillside covered in explosions.  I really think that the quality of a good movie, and especially a western, can be seen most of the time in how well the director handles an opening sequence.  He/she should capitalize on the viewer's total lack of knowledge about the film's situation to create moments of suspense or drama that couldn't possibly occur once the story is set in motion.  He should also use this suspense to create tension that will carry the movie forward.  Nicholas Ray has done an excellent job of this here; we see Hayden riding through the explosions and wonder what's going on, and then we see (through his eyes) the bank holdup, which he is doing nothing to stop.  We don't know if he's a part of the robbery, we can't really see who's doing the robbing, etc. etc. -- it just brings up a lot of questions that keep the audience wanting to see more.\\\\nAn excellent production, one of Republic's best.\",\n",

Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream.

       " 'The archetypal action film, Seven Samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid. Each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc, his or her own vital part to play in the film\\'s slow progression towards its dramatic finale. Typically, Kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry; each and every shot, each action sequence, is exquisitely composed; and yet none seems contrived or out-of-place within the overall fabric of the work. Everything is beautifully conceived and in focus, both literally and figuratively.When watching Seven Samurai, movie lovers will immediately recognize that several of its key elements can be readily detected in countless similar films made during the last half-century. The audition scenes, in which several samurai are recruited for the difficult task of defending a farming town from a group of bandits, strikes a particularly familiar chord, as do those showing the samurai training the lowly villagers to fight and use weapons. Indeed, the theme of a highly experienced group of \\\\\"tough guys\\\\\" taking up the cause of the disenfranchised has become something of an action film cliche, portions of which echo throughout the American western, as well as its progeny (think The Dirty Dozen, The Road Warrior or even television\\'s The A Team).But what really stands out in Seven Samurai are its characters. They run the gamut, from elder teacher to hopeful youth, stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand. Kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance, not to mention the mix of poor and beleaguered townspeople he depicts within the setting of the town. Perhaps its no wonder the enemy bandits are virtually faceless-- there is so much conflict and passion present within the group of protagonists, the villains need not be more than a vague threat. Through it all Kurosawa never forgets who these people are and where they stand in comparison to one another. Obviously, the samurai are, for the most part, samurai, while the townspeople are merely peasants, lacking even in funds to pay their noble defenders. Kurosawa deftly illustrates these class differences by having one peasant fear horribly for the honor of his daughter, who he suspects will be lured by the wealth of the samurai; and also by giving us one samurai who is no samurai at all, but merely a peasant himself whose own farming village was in his youth destroyed by marauding warriors. The film thus wraps a a portrait of class conflict in a cloak of solidarity. The samurai unite to defend the poor peasants, but the ending is not exactly happy for them. Nor are the peasants completely honorable. We learn, for instance, that they have in the past murdered defeated samurai and looted their bodies, and it becomes apparent late in the film that their claims of poverty are perhaps not as truthful as at first seemed apparent.So why do the samurai defend them so valiantly? For honor? For love of adventure? The answer to this question is left intentionally vague; it is up to each viewer to draw his or her own conclusions. It is to the film\\'s credit that it forces such questions upon us while never allowing them to cause the motivations of its characters to seem untrue.Modern viewers will find the action sequences of Seven Samurai to be restrained. There are, for instance, no \\\\\"Gladiator\\\\\" or \\\\\"Braveheart\\\\\" moments in which limbs are visibly hacked off, blood flies and speakers pound with booming audio. But the action is wonderfully filmed and there is some early use of slow motion to accentuate key moments. The 3 1/2 hour running time may also deter some, but I find the length to be one of the film\\'s charms; it takes its dear sweet time in exposing its riches, and no single moment feels underdeveloped or awkward. Don\\'t miss it.10/10',\n",

       " \"Having taught in the New York City school system for 32 years and now retired, I am quite qualified to comment on this ground-breaking film.When it came out, few people realized how bad some of our urban schools were. The truth is that the situation is even far worse today.This great film attempts to show the truth about our urban school centers. It depicts the complete lack of discipline as well as a totally inept and unsympathetic school administration. The latter will hide incidents to show that their school is a good one.Glenn Ford is terrific as the idealistic teacher. Having come from the military, he soon sees that the school is worse than many army situations he has encountered.Gang violence is prevalent. Student disruption is constant. Vic Morrow and his gang of thugs, (yes, Mayor Bloomberg, they are thugs not Transit Workers) do their best to make sure that no one learns anything and that mayhem is the general order of the day.The scene where Richard Kiley's records are destroyed in front of him by these recalcitrants is memorable.If our society would only realize what these schools have become and do something about it. Instead, teachers are routinely blamed. Teachers must be psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers,and parents for so many who resist learning and authority.The film was an omen for what was to come. Sadly, we have not learned from it. Yes, we try catch phrases like cooperative learning, etc. But the fact remains that teaching cannot be done until there is effective discipline.An A+ for what this film tries to show. Nonetheless, the worst was yet to come.\",\n",

And huge kudos to Brigitte Auber, who was gorgeous and very good.

Grant (with his accent) could really never be mistaken for an American, even though he usually played one. Also it was a little eerie to see Grace Kelly driving so fast on those French Riviera cliffside roads, in light of what happened to her later.

       " 'Christine Penmark (Nancy Kelly) is the daughter of a famous writer, Richard Bravo (Paul Fix). She\\'s married to Kenneth (William Hopper), a military Colonel who seems to spend most of his time away from home, usually on short-term call in some other city. The landlady of their apartment building, Monica Breedlove (Evelyn Varden), is obsessed with psychology, having even been analyzed by Freud. Because of this, she courts friendships with other intellectuals, including a criminology author, Reginald Tasker (Gage Clarke). But by far the most important character is Christine\\'s young daughter, Rhoda (Patricia McCormick).Rhoda is oddly adult in her behavior. She goes out of her way to excel at everything she does, to be prim and proper, to seem amicable and innocent. However, in the wake of one of Rhoda\\'s classmates falling victim to a drowning accident while on a school picnic, suspicion falls on Rhoda. As more facts come out, Christine realizes with horror that her child just might be a \\\\\"bad seed\\\\\".A tightly focused ensemble piece, heavy on dialogue and taking place primarily in one interior location, The Bad Seed is one of the better but more understated horror films from the 1950s. Because of its ideas, its unusual portrayal of a manipulatively \\\\\"evil\\\\\" child (and a weirdly cute young girl at that), and its nihilistic and abruptly mind-blowing ending, The Bad Seed was quite a shocking film in 1956. In my book, it still is. That\\'s not to say that the film is graphic. Much more so than, say, The Haunting (1963), The Bad Seed is the classic example of how something implied and not shown can be just as effective and disturbing as something shown.Still, not everyone loves it, of course. \\\\\"Staginess\\\\\" is often cited with either a direct claim or an implication that that quality is necessarily a flaw. The Bad Seed\\'s \\\\\"staginess\\\\\" is easily explicable. It is a film adaptation of a play by Maxwell Anderson, which was itself adapted from William March\\'s last novel, published in 1954. It\\'s easy to see how only minor changes would allow the film to be performed on a stage. However, I don\\'t see The Bad Seed\\'s staginess as a flaw. It\\'s not as if plays are bad merely for the fact that they\\'re plays, right? There seems to be some unspoken or unanalyzed attendant assumption that cinema shouldn\\'t bear strong similarities to other artistic media and/or a belief that cinema should always be \\\\\"naturalistic\\\\\". I don\\'t agree with either of those assumptions. Cinema can do many different things. It shouldn\\'t all just be one way or another.Rather than being a flaw, the staginess of The Bad Seed is an asset. It catalyzed the effective \\\\\"tell, don\\'t show\\\\\" attitude towards the film\\'s violence. It allows all attention to be placed on the fantastic ensemble performances, and especially on McCormack, who turns in the best young female performance this side of Dakota Fanning. And it helps make the film feel like the parable that it is.Under director Mervyn LeRoy\\'s hand, The Bad Seed is an extended meditation on two philosophical ideas--twisted psychologies and the nature versus nurture debate. It\\'s not just Rhoda who has psychologically-rooted problems and dysfunctions, but everyone in the film. Christine is in denial, and shows that she has long been in denial, about her happiness, her life and her daughter. She continually tries to act as if everything is kosher and normal, but as the film progresses, she has periodic cracks in the armor, until the \\\\\"breakdown\\\\\" at the end--and even in the midst of that, she tries to act as if everything is okay and mundane. Monica, who keeps trying to psychoanalyze everyone (except the one person she most needs to psychoanalyze), tends to also intellectually browbeat or overpower them. Kenneth is an absentee husband. Leroy Jessup (Henry Jones), the apartment maintenance man, presents himself as just as twisted, deceptive and manipulative as Rhoda, and there is a pedophile subtext with the character. Claudia Fern (Joan Croydon), the head of Rhoda\\'s school, seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and also seems to be in denial, as does Christine\\'s father Richard, who also has elements of absenteeism and emotional distancing. Hortense Daigle (Eileen Heckart), the mother of the drowned boy, is an alcoholic, and her tragedy puts her over the edge. In fact, the only character in the entire film who seems well-adjusted is Reginald, and perhaps that\\'s symbolic of his function as a criminologist.The nature versus nurture material is incorporated in an unusual way. Characters debate this to an extent, but most take the nurture side. However, the film itself makes more of an argument for the nature side, and Christine, despite being in denial, comes to believe the nature side, as does Reginald, the even-keeled character. In fact, William March (the author of the novel) believed more in the nature side, and said as much to colleagues while he was working on the book, including doing research into psychotic killers.What helps to amp up the disturbing qualities of the film is that Rhoda is manipulating the audience as well as she is manipulating other characters. Only very seldom does LeRoy have her \\\\\"true nature\\\\\" come through, and it\\'s a shock to us in the same way that it\\'s a shock to the other characters. The ending of the book was changed to be in line with the \\\\\"moral code\\\\\" for Hollywood films at the time, but the resultant, somewhat bizarre ending, is probably more shocking in retrospect than March\\'s original ending would have been. There have been many horror films over the years with endings somewhat similar to March\\'s. There haven\\'t been many that end in quite the same way that The Bad Seed does.While the film would certainly require a bit of adjustment for many younger modern horror fans, it is well worth watching, especially if you\\'ve become acclimated to slower-paced, dramatic, understated horror.',\n",
       " 'FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . As soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . We meet the unforgetable Robbie , the mysterious Dr Morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - The Krell who died out overnight . Or did they ? You can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron`s electronic music adds even more atmosphere I`m shocked this film isn`t in the top 250 IMDB films .',\n",
       " \"Strange what time does. I wasn't in a hurry to see Giant again. I had a fuzzy memory of the film. I remembered James Dean but I also remembered the length and the pace. Now in 2018 it had a completely different effect. I was riveted from beginning to end. Elizabeth Taylor ! How is it that I didn't remember the groundbreaking aspect of her character. She's a woman of the future tied by marriage to a reactionary past. I was born in Italy but I've been married to a Texan for 23 years. I know Texas well and I know the difference between Texas and New York as well as Texans who never left Texas and Texans who have lived and traveled elsewhere. Giant, made in 1956 tells us that without partisan bias. That's how it was and how, in many respects still is. James Dean, magic, of course Rock Hudson is terrific but it is Elizabeth Taylor's film. Carroll Baker, Dennis Hopper, Mercedes McCambridge and Sal Mineo are moving parts of this arid and beautiful landscape.\",\n",

She is spectacular and the absurdity becomes totally real just by looking at her. James Stewart is great of course but he seems to be the foil here rather than the center that keeps us connected to that essential leap of faith. The scene in which he gives her the tranquilizers before telling her the terrible news. What Doris Day manages to do with her character is extraordinary. Brenda de Banzie is a terrific villainess and Bernard Herrmann's score another major plus. I'm sure that even my grandchildren's grandchildren will talk about The Man Who Knew Too Much and about Doris Day.\",\n",
       " \"The parting of the red sea! The confrontation at Mount Sinai! This movie is full of spectacular scenes and images! De Mille truly was a great filmmaker. His powerful imagination is evident in the Ten Commandments. This is his masterpiece. It carries you along on an epic adventure that is as big as the old testament. It captures the ancient, epic feel of the original Bible story. It has several stunning performances that could have easily been cheesy and fake, but are convincing and fascinating. Some say that the dialog is campy. I don't think so. I've seen this movie many times and have never thought so. It's nothing like the terrible dialog in Plan 9 From Outer Space from the same decade. The romance may be a clich\\\\u00e9 now, but it was quite original when it first came out and is still interesting. I personally don't like romance, so the fact that I wasn't bothered by this one is really saying something. This marvelous story is wonderfully told by De Mille and I would strongly recommend it.\",\n",
       " \"This movie is a prime example of the work of one of the masters of stop-motion animation, a form of art that is rapidly being supplanted by CGI. Ray Harryhausen was the ultimate master of this technique, having trained under the likes of Willis O'Brian. His work is still the inspiration for many of the special effects wizards today. Granted, the movies of the 1950's do seem stilted and silly, but quite frankly, the worst of them are probably still superior to most of the direct-to-video drek produced today, and likely better than most of the films produced by major studios. I was raised on films such as 20 Million Miles to Earth and have no problem letting my child watch films like this. I cannot say the same for most of what is released today. 20 Million Miles to Earth is a unique, fun film. It, like others of its kind, comes from a different era, when people were not as jaded and world-savvy as they are today. Save the critical eye for the more cynical, overproduced films of today. Enjoy it for what it is.\",\n",

It\\'s lasting quality can be seen in other movies that have followed by deriving inspiration from the use of the Empire State Building as an iconic tower representing romance and this is a testament to the importance and relevance of this movie decades later.

       " 'In my opinion, 12 Angry Men is the greatest film that has ever been created. A perfect example of less is more, the simplicity of the plot, the setting of the one room, and the acting talent of the 12 main cast members is enough to conquer the dramatic genre, and ensure that it remains a timeless classic.Whether you are a fan of the older generation of filmmaking or not, I implore you to experience this acting masterclass for yourself. More current movies such as Resevoir Dogs, which is superb in itself, have borrowed elements from 12 Angry Men, but trust me when I say there is nothing quite like this beautifully crafted drama. Watch it.',\n",
       " 'An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - \\\\\"this is not an exact science\\\\\") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it\\'s worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy\\'s social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy\\'s - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.',\n",

The characters were too broadly drawn to be believable especially the role of Lee J. Cobb. Where is the complexity?

       " '12 Angry Men is entertaining, mostly well acted, and worth a watch. It could have been far better but, from the outset, the film was designed only to take a pot-shot at the Right, and promote a Left Wing Progressive viewpoint as the absolute truth. This story is hardcore propaganda and, judging by its score on IMDb, has succeeded in fooling a great number of people. What is interesting to me is that the Left-wing\\'s brainwashing started this early. Hollywood is still churning out the same bias today (go and read my Dark Knight review).The movie has a very interesting premise: An open-and-shut case is called in to question when one man on the twelve-man jury slowly convinces the others that the eighteen year old on trial for the murder of his father may, in fact, be innocent. That\\'s got some real potential, hasn\\'t it? Sadly, the gone-in-the-head Leftist who wrote this did what I feared he would: loaded the dice and peddled a Leftist agenda - namely one that excuses criminals of their actions and seeks to end the death penalty. That\\'s the film\\'s overwhelming goal. It wants the audience to come away from the movie, not with a greater appreciation of the legal system, but with the view that the death penalty should be abolished and that anyone who objects to this is a deluded, little bigot. Let\\'s look at the facts we are given:-Spoilers from here on- 1. An 18 year old is on trial for the murder of his father. He has no alibi. The alibi he gave to police (that he was in a theatre the whole time) fell apart when he could not recall anything about the movies that were showing - even their names.2. There are two main witnesses: One saw the defendant leaving the scene of the crime (and heard the event); the other saw the murder take place through a window and identified the defendant. The defendant was also heard shouting in anger \\'I\\'m gonna kill you\\', the same day as the murder.3. The knife (with a very rare design) used in the murder is the same knife that the defendant had bought earlier and was carrying around. His friends testified to this effect.4. The defendant is an habitual criminal who has had numerous run-ins with the law, including two arrests for knife fighting. He is said to be \\'real handy with a knife\\'.5. The defendant has a clear motive: His father was repeatedly violent and abusive towards him, and had beaten him regularly (with fists) since he was five years of age, including the day of the murder.I was intrigued. Why does this one juror believe the defendant may not be guilty? How could he convince the rest that there is reasonable doubt? Despite the fact I feared these questions would receive fob-offs, I was still hopeful an intelligent investigation would be crafted around them. But no. Straight away, the film deliberately loads the dice by having certain jurors holding prejudiced or otherwise undesirable traits, while the dissenting voice is calm, collected, and supremely open-minded. That\\'s clich\\\\u00e9, and a very common Leftist tactic (you\\'ll see it a lot on shows like Star Trek).The film takes each of the facts above and finds an absurd alternate explanation for them, such as the knife could have fallen out of the defendants pocket and the true murderer used an identical knife (this is the fantastic explanation given by our Leftist hero). The film has a moronic moment where the \\'hero\\' pulls out a knife he has bought (illegally), which appears identical to the one in question. The idea being that it isn\\'t so rare, after all.Other silly moments include the jury discussing why the defendant would come home a few hours later if he had indeed done the crime. Not one of them mentions that the defendant lives there and would have to come back home in order to allay fears that he was the murderer. It\\'s part of an alibi. What else is he going to do, disappear and hope that the police don\\'t find that a tad suspicious? Nearly every explanation given in favour of the defendant is absurd or complete conjecture.When you string all the known facts together, the chances of them all being explained away in a fashion that exonerates the defendant is literally millions to one. It\\'s so implausible that no sane jury would acquit. But the writer wants this to happen, so it does (and 12-0 in favour, just in case you missed the point). I love it when writers do that. Don\\'t you? At one point, the following dialogue takes place:\\\\\"No-one can know a thing like that; this isn\\'t an exact science.\\\\\" \\\\\"That\\'s right, it isn\\'t.\\\\\" Okay, then, let\\'s just forget putting people on trial because we can hardly ever be 100% sure that they did the crime in question, can we? The number of victims created by having no deterrent, or by allowing dangerous criminals to go free, is FAR GREATER than the absolute minority case where an innocent person is found guilty. Some people cannot be reasoned with and are far too broken to be rehabilitated. They are like a dangerous dog. We don\\'t try to change the nature of a dangerous dog because we know it\\'s futile, and we know that by ignoring it, we are just risking more innocent lives. This really isn\\'t rocket science, it\\'s just that the Leftist types (who have a huge stranglehold on the media/TV) refuse to budge, and muddy the waters with their insane Progressive agenda.People cheering this movie are cheering for a violent thug, who got away with first-degree murder. It\\'s not hip, it\\'s just dumb. Wake up.My rating: 3/5',\n",
       " 'When reviewing on imdb, the window pops up a selection between spoiler or no spoiler for your review. can one spoil a movie this flat? this predictable?

In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics.

       " \"When MGM filmed Raintree County it had high hopes that it would be a second Gone With The Wind. It didn't quite come up to that, but it is still a good film on its own merits.It took about 10 years for MGM to finally bring this to the screen. Shortly before the tragic suicide of author Ross Lockridge, MGM acquired the screen rights to this one and only novel by Lockridge which was a number one best seller in post World War II years. The story opens in ante bellum Civil War Indiana, specifically in RaintreeCounty. Our hero is John Shawnessy, a sort of aimless young man who teaches school for lack of better direction. He's a sensitive soul with deep abolitionist convictions and no one was a more sensitive soul on the screen than Montgomery Clift.If all had gone well, Monty would have probably married the girl from home played by Eva Marie Saint. But a visiting Southern belle played by Elizabeth Taylor in her best fiddle-dee-dee Scarlett O'Hara manner sweeps Monty off his feet. He hasn't got a prayer. But Liz Taylor got her first Academy Award nomination not for simply imitating Scarlett O'Hara. Her role requires her to descend into the madness of Vivien Leigh's other Southern belle Oscar part, Blanche Dubois. It's on this devolution of character that Liz Taylor the actress really shines. She lost the Oscar sweepstakes that year to Joanne Woodward's Three Faces of Eve.The film almost wasn't finished because of a horrible automobile accident that nearly killed Monty Clift during production. As it was, it was held up for three months while the best plastic surgeons looked to reconstruct Montgomery Clift's face. You can see clearly those shots before and after the accident.Liz Taylor in her documentary tribute to her favorite leading man and best friend in the world said that Monty Clift did not lose the physical beauty, but he did lose the delicacy of his features which were her own words. In a strange way it probably helped his performance because John Shawnessy does go to war and war is an experience known for scarring and aging people. As in A Place In the Sun, Monty and Liz's scenes together have that extra dimension that people who care about each other deeply can give a scene. Raintree County should be seen for that alone.Eva Marie Saint as the good girl from home does all right, but her character just doesn't have the depth that Liz's and Monty's do. Eva Marie is just given less to work with. Others in this nicely rounded cast are Lee Marvin as Clift's friend and rival from his hometown, Agnes Moorehead and Walter Abel as Clift's parents, Rod Taylor as a sleazy politician and Nigel Patrick who observes it all as a wandering reprobate who takes a liking to Clift.It's not Gone With the Wind, but it's pretty good.\",\n",
       " \"We trace the journey of an elderly professor who is traveling to receive an honor for a life of accomplishment and service. Along the way he confronts the lack of success in his human relationships as opposed to the success he has enjoyed professionally. A string of encounters with the past and with iconic people he meets gradually bring the contrast into focus for the viewer.I particularly liked the subtle and intelligent storytelling in this film. He tells us before the credits that he is just a boring pedant. We realize as he comes to realize what this has really meant to him. We slowly receive hints of the emotional truths that frame the man's life. He is confronted by traces of how things could have been different.Important points are hinted at without being said--the viewer is left to sort them out. For example, the couple at the gas station convince us in a short and seemingly banal exchange that the Professor was a great healer whose service to those outside his family was anything but sterile. Yet speaking to his daughter-in-law, his smug insistence that a debt must be paid gives us a glimpse at what it must have been like for his son to have been held at emotional bay by bloodless, cold rationalism.This film deserves NOT to be remade, in order to preserve its artistic integrity.

As good as \\'Witness For The Prosecution\\' is---Agatha Christie\\'s story, the other actors, the technical expertise---the Oscar-nominated Laughton is THE reason to see this film. What he brings to Billy Wilder\\'s 1957 courtroom thriller is his tremendous wit and intellect. It\\'s a serious story, but the dark-comic tag team of Wilder/Laughton upgraded the film from \\\\\"a good courtroom mystery\\\\\" to \\\\\"a classic of the courtroom genre\\\\\".The headlining star, Tyrone Power, sure doesn\\'t help them very much. He plays anguish about as smoothly as ripped sandpaper...and anguish is the unfortunate emotion he\\'s got to play for most of the picture. Power has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. His wife (Marlene Dietrich) seems to be doing all she can to sell him out, appearing as...drum roll, please, drummer man...the star witness for the prosecution. Laughton is the brilliant (and ailing) English barrister defending Power. The plot twists \\'n\\' turns a dozen ways from Sunday, just as it always does in Christie\\'s best work.Amongst all the talk of bloody murder, there are running gags about cigars and alcohol. More dark wit---Laughton\\'s character\\'s poor health might cause him to drop dead at any moment. Wilder weaved thrills and smiles as well as any director. In this, he was wise to anchor the supporting cast with mainstays of the stiff upper lip. John Williams and Ian Wolfe (Hirsch from \\\\\"WKRP\\\\\"), not to mention Laughton\\'s control-freak assistant Elsa Lanchester (who was also CL\\'s real-life wife), are bloody good.Movies of this type have been ripped off so often that students of the \\\\\"don\\'t give away the ending\\\\\" class are bound to figure it out. I did. That hardly mattered because there were STILL more surprises to come. Through all that plot, Dietrich winds up being the most fascinating character. Project back and you\\'ll realize how well her performance works. But she &amp; Power are merely the star attractions in \\'Witness For The Prosecution\\'. The main dish is Charles Laughton. Considering how ironic and cynical our society has become, it\\'s stunning that brilliant old pros like Wilder and Laughton aren\\'t more popular today. After this movie, they\\'ve become personal heroes of mine.',\n",
       " \"A film I have not seen for years but will always remember with fondness. A classic thriller with all the right ingredients - Power and Dietrich are spectacular, and, by early standards (and recent ones!), the twist is excellent. Charles Laughton however, provides us with a glib chuckle as the aging defense attorney ruled by his overlord maid. A distraction that only adds to an excellent plot line.I can't imagine another film of the genre and the era, that so wickedly entangles the essential thriller with a 'crime of passion' (oops, spot the plot killer...) gem. A classic. A film for true movie lovers. Take it from me!\",\n",
       " 'To see \\\\\"Witness for the Prosecution\\\\\" for the first time in 2008 is a jolting surprise. Nobody could do it better than Billy Wilder did in 1957. A man accused of murder, Tyrone Power, the weakest link in this terrific chain. Sir Wilfred is called to defend him, he is played by the extraordinary Charles Laughton, but he\\'s just out of hospital - he wasn\\'t dismissed he was expelled - and due to doctor\\'s orders he\\'s not to take any criminal cases. He finds Power charming and personable enough but he\\'s not going to risk his life to save his until Marlene Dietrich makes her entrance - and what an entrance! How marvelous that what amounts to a bit of Agatha Christie\\'s usual fare becomes such an entertaining and at times right down riveting piece of film-making.',\n",

All the actors/actresses are a perfect fit for their roles, and the male cast of Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Burl Ives, and Chuck Connors (who shines as the thoroughly bad Buck Hannassey) is ensemble acting at it's best.

       " \"Anatomy Of a Murder is probably Otto Preminger's best film. It's certainly my favorite. Adapted from a novel by Robert Traver, it tells the story of a lawyer in northern Michigan and his defense of a particularly surly and violent murderer. As is always the case with Preminger, scenes are filmed mostly with all the characters present in the frame. There is no cross-cutting to speak of, which is to say the drama plays out with the assorted characters confronting one another, or at any rate with one another, and the effect is one of surprising warmth and good feeling in the movie's cosier scenes, which for once enhance rather than detract from the drama. I would have been quite happy to have spent much more time in lawyer Biegler's house and study, with its books, old furniture and broken typewriter, but alas this is a murder case so one has to get down to businss. The question of whether the defendant, an army officer, was temporarily insane, is in fact insane, or is merely putting on a good show, is never fully resolved. The lawyer is by no means perfect. He's a little lazy, though he gets over it. One senses he's cheap. He enjoys his shabby genteel bachelor's life and isn't always responsive to the needs of his secretary, who would like to get paid more regularly. In the end he proves far more dedicated and brilliant than we might have first imagined him to be, but the fly in the buttermilk is that the better he gets the more complicated the case becomes, and the more ambiguous everything gets the more he finds out about his client and the man he killed. In this respect the movie is a masterpiece of ambiguity. Beautifully shot on location in black and white, it is more gray than anything else. Morally gray. No one is quite what he appears to be at first. And people change; or rather we learn more about them. The bartender at the resort where his boss was killed at first comes off as a jerk; in time he comes to seem more of a jerk. Then he seems maybe not so bad after all; and then he's a jerk once more, but a jerk we understand. The lawyer's assistant, an on-again, off-again recovering alcoholic, is also a mixed bag. He is dogged but sloppy, and always (or so it appears) on the verge of breakdown. Or at least this is how Arthur O'Connell plays him. The prosecuting attorney is a dolt, but he is aided by a legal bigwig the state has brought in, but this hotshot is no match for the cunning country lawyer. The defendant's wife, who 'started the whole thing' is gorgeous, sexy and provocative. She makes a play for her husband's lawyer, but he doesn't bite. One wonders about her. And one wonders about the marriage she and her hot-tempered spouse really have, and whether it will last. This is a very sophisticated and adult movie for 1959, or for that matter today. The location filming greatly enhances the mood, chilly and very upper midwestern. Yet indoors one feels different, and the tone is often playful. The actors are superb. James Stewart is gritty, lovable, homespun, physically slow and mentally quick; and for all the familiarity there is about his screen persona, out of character, that is, in character he manages continually to surprise and delight. He was a true actor. Ben Gazzara is very Method actorish, which suits him well in his role as the volatile military man. Lee Remick is stunning as his wife, and one can well imagine a man killing for her, many times over. She is also a good actress. George C. Scott plays the state's bulldog prosecutor well, though he's an acquired taste at best. His hamminess contrasts with Stewart's folksy naturalism in interesting ways not ungermane to the plot, but he is out-acted and outclassed by the old pro he is presumably upstaging in this film.\",\n",
       " \"'Anatomy of a Murder' illustrates vividly how one lawyer repeatedly faces the heat of a controversial rape-case courtroom battle... The film might be Stewart's finest performance... For his magnificent achievement, Stewart was nominated for an Academy Award... The film itself received a total of seven Oscars in various categories, but was overtaken by William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur', the blockbuster of that year, whose star, Charlton Heston, beat out Stewart for best actor...'Anatomy of a Murder' is one of the few great racy courtroom melodramas ever put on the screen... It is a study of characters superbly detailed, in which a simple country lawyer zealously defends a young Army lieutenant charged with clearly gunning down a bar-owner who, he alleges, raped his young wife... The murder takes place some time after Remick tells her husband (Gazzara) she was raped\\\\u0096enough time to suggest that the killing was not done in the heat of passion but with some deliberation... Stewart, a warm bachelor lawyer with an old-fashioned grace of manner, is wonderfully believable as the qualified defense attorney, who tries to establish whether or not Lee Remick has been raped... He masterfully guides his defendant to the most exciting climax, repeatedly drawing forth evidence which he knows to be inadmissible, but which he wants the jury to hear... Stewart smokes cheap cigars, plays jazz piano, and restrains beautifully Remick's flirtatious overtures, but his benevolence is never in question... We see him hauling the provocative Remick from out of the bar telling her to be a good, and submissive housewife for the court...Stewart studies with a cynical eye the peculiar traits of the accused, tolerates, with amused resignation, his friend's drunken lapses, and competently makes his point to the judge and jury...Ben Gazzara proves to be a problematic client, close to uncooperative with his lawyer... Also, it is very clear that he is a jealously possessive man, which is enough to question the validity of the rape charge, he claims that he acted in a moment of insane anger... The film raises fascinating legal highlights on disorders of jealousy...Lee Remick gives a sensational performance as the sexy wife whose missing panties form a vital part of the evidence... Remick knows how to attract and seduce... She is so coquettish that she drives her angry husband to murder... The trial poses tricky questions: Was the Remick character in advanced levels of seduction during her wanderings at the neighborhood bar? Did her bruises come from the man whom she claimed raped her, or from her jealous husband? George C. Scott plays the sly, sardonic prosecuting attorney who offers the character a wonderful air of arrogance and superiority, unnerving with his aggressive antagonism witnesses and defense attorney...Arthur O'Connell rises to the occasion when his lawyer-hero needs him...Eve Arden is Stewart's faithful and efficient secretary eager that the Manion case might bring her a long-overdue paycheck... The courtroom fencing between Stewart and Scott is so convincing with the casting of Joseph N. Welch as the delightful ever-patient judge, Harlan Weaver... Judge Weaver, whose patience is repeatedly tried by the grotesque gestures of the lawyers in the case, appears too kindly to be much of a courtroom disciplinarian... But in the tension between the shrewd old judge and the lawyer for defense, the film raises a crucial issue on the rules of advocacy: To what extent a lawyer should represent a client zealously within the rules and norms of courtroom etiquette? Preminger's penchant for long takes and a mobile camera, rather than cuts and conversational reaction shots, here serves both to illuminate the crucial ambiguities in the characters, and to facilitate an objective appraisal of the mechanics of the legal process... Preminger challenges the American censors over the candid sexual terminology and explicit examination of rape in his courtroom drama... Ellington's score brilliantly captures the tension and the moral ambiguity that characterize the movie... Sam Leavitt's black-and-white photography is particularly impressive, setting as it does the stark mood of the authentic Michigan locations...\",\n",

The film is from the late fifties so there is no big special effects like \\\\\"saving private Ryan\\\\\".

       " 'Seeing \\\\\"Compulsion\\\\\" again after a very long time, it amazed me how well I remembered it. In fact I remembered every tiny little turn in Dean Stockwell\\'s eyes. He is superb in the part of the young semi genius with a weakness for the shallow Bradford Dillman. The Leopold and Loeb case was the base for this thrilling Richard Fleischer film. It won acting awards for Stockwell, Dillman and Orson Welles at the Cannes Film Festival but with the benefit of hindsight, Dean Stockwell emerges as the winner against the famous test of time. Dillman seems a little bit too everything. Welles is great fun to watch and E G Marshall is terrific as the man determined to unmask the \\\\\"powder poofs\\\\\". Stockwell fainting at the trial, something that could have been so over the top, is in fact, shattering. The Leopold and Loeb story was also the base for Hitchcock\\'s \\\\\"Rope\\\\\" and the wonderful Tom Kalin\\'s \\\\\"Swoon\\\\\" Another version was rumored in 1991, directed by Martin Donovan with River Phoenix in the Stockwell part.',\n",
       " \"Vertigo is a good movie by a great director. Viewing Vertigo several times recently, and reading Dan Aulier's brilliant in-depth look at the making of this movie, I am at a loss to explain what I see as a vastly hyperbolic reaction to this movie by many people both in the realm of professional critics and posters on IMDb. This is not Hitchcock at his best, although I do believe it could have been. True, Hitchcock was at his peak in this period, but there are enough flaws in Vertigo to bring this potential masterwork down several notches.The first problem in Vertigo lies with the story's failure to establish Scottie Ferguson. We first meet Scottie as he fails to make the rooftop leap and is hanging by a gutter of a building several dozen feet from the ground. After this we see him making his decision to retire from police work. The audience is deprived of any referent to the type of person Scottie was before the incident on the rooftop. This failure to establish the character and set a benchmark to measure his return by in the closing minutes of the film deprives the audience of a vital connection to any character. But this problem could have easily been overcome had the third fatal flaw, which I will take up soon, been avoided.The second problem in Vertigo is a decision by Hitchcock and George Tomasini, the editor, to insert a scene shortly after Scottie meets Judy that reveals all of the secrets the story holds. This throws away the element of suspense that might have had audiences on the edge of their seats during the final part of the movie, unable to relax even at the moment of revelation for Scottie's character as the movie would sweep them up and hurl them through the roller-coaster ride that the climax of the movie should have been. But I think Hitchcock and company made the decision as a direct result of an even earlier and worse mistake.The third, and most glaring, mistake Hitchcock made with Vertigo was in the casting. Most of the cast does work ranging from passable to outstanding, with one notable exception: Jimmy Stewart. In Aulier's account of the Vertigo project he details how Stewart came to star in this movie, which had a lot more to do with the desires of Lew Wasserman, agent to both Stewart and Hitchcock, than good judgment. Jimmy Stewart was the wrong man for this role, and Aulier recounts that Hitchcock himself blamed Stewart for Vertigo's dismal showing at the box office. Hitchcock concluded that Stewart was too old for the part and refused to cast him in North by Northwest because of this. But I don't think Stewart's age was the real hindrance here, I think Jimmy Stewart tried to step way beyond his range as an actor and falls flat in certain key scenes. Mr. Stewart does a passable job in the first half of the movie, and is quite believable as the ex-detective brought low by his vertigo-inducing acrophobia. The first real hint of trouble comes in the last scene of the first half, Scottie sits in a sanitarium incommunicado and withdrawn as his stalwart friend Midge tries to engage him in conversation. Stewart's playing of this borders on the comedic with a deer-in-the-headlights gaze that calls to mind one of the Warner Brother's toons after being conked on the head rather than a man ravaged by guilt. It drags the scene down so much that Barbara Bel Geddes is left to carry it on her own, and she does make a valiant attempt but her efforts are hindered by Stewart. From this point forward the movie enters its most crucial phase and Stewart's ineffectualness grows more obvious in each successive scene. In the scene where Scottie tries to convince Judy to change her hair color Stewart's phrasing and pitch are semi-comedic. The lack of chemistry between the two leads brings the haunting scene of Judy's emergence from the bathroom to a crashing halt as Stewart is unable to infuse his performance with even a modicum of passion. But a few minutes later Stewart's performance goes completely south as the movie's climatic moments unfold. Scottie is righteously angry as the truth dawns on him, but, unfortunately, Stewart does not play angry well at all. His maniacal and slightly feminine delivery from this point on detracts from what could have been cinematic magic. At a point in the movie where Scottie should have regained his senses and his sense of manhood his tone and pitch shrilly foreshadow the strident tones of Mrs. Bates in Hitchcock's next project.No doubt my remarks here will be met with disdain by some of the film's more ardent boosters on IMDb. I shall join the ranks of the great unwashed heathens who do not understand great cinema nor Vertigo's rightful placement at the apex of that pyramidal structure. I do appreciate Hitchcock's use of color as subtext in the film (I am particularly fond of the color and lighting shifts in Midge's apartment when she allows Scottie to view her painting). I also appreciate and easily grasp the undertones of Hitchcock's own obsessive behavior with the leading ladies of his work, but wonder if that subtext was intended as dramatic irony or whether Mr. Hitchcock was even aware of the mirror he was peering into. But, the brilliant touches of a master artist are not enough to make up for what this film lacks. Hitchcock was indeed The Master, and his body of work stands above a field of mostly mediocre efforts that his peers were turning out, and even today not one exists who can approach his mastery, but to suggest that Vertigo is the cinematic equivalent of Leonardo's Mona Lisa is ludicrous and undeserved.\",\n",
       " 'Hiroshima is at the heart of this deceptively simple story. Hiroshima not only as the city which received the fatal bomb on the morning of August 9, 1945, at 9:15 AM, but Hiroshima as the city of Nevers which the woman tries to escape from (but ultimately can\\'t), and Hiroshima as the Japanese man with whom she is having a clandestine affair. The tragedy of the past dresses and undresses them like the ashes seen at the beginning of the film, superimposed on the glistening sweat from the protagonists\\' lovemaking... an act that will not be repeated after, or throughout the movie. Theirs is an affair that will remain devoid of a fulfilling consummation.We don\\'t know much about these two people in the beginning: She (Emmanuelle Riva) is in Hiroshima filming scenes for an anti-war movie; he lost his family to the bombing and knows of the pain and the inconsolable loss. The Actress tells him (Eiji Okada) she knows of loss as well, and can identify. At first, we don\\'t know what is under her skin, or why she calmly tells him there will be no more meetings, that he will go away. It is his staying, faithful, by her side, that causes her to slowly peel away at the layers of pain that have lingered just under the surface for 14 years now, eating at her, wanting some form of exorcism.Rarely has there been such naked intimacy told or filmed on screen in such unconventional manner, de-glamorizing the actors, almost depersonalizing their egos, for the sake of telling a story that took place years ago, but is still present in her mind and soul and is still happening, in an endless repetition, over and over again. Being in Hiroshima only intensifies her grief and overall isolation. Knowing the affair must eventually end and that they will go back to their lives practically turns her to stone in one scene, as morning arrives.Here is the real tragedy of the story: that we have come to care for both of these people, that they have somehow formed a bond that has been able to rise, like Hiroshima, from the ashes of the past, but that the isolation and inner torment that still rages prevents there being any simple solution -- no Hollywood ending where She will carry out her impulsive decision (that she makes one, to stay, is here, but only in desire, not action), and from what little we still know of Him, no statement that He will leave his unseen, unnamed wife. They will part, and her exclamation near the end: \\\\\"I am forgetting you already!\\\\\" is an act, a defense mechanism. She hasn\\'t forgotten the incident at Nevers (which becomes her symbolic name at the end), nor will she forget this man whom at the end has named himself Hiroshima, in remembrance.',\n",

Even though it is over more than four decennia old it feels surprisingly new. The reason for this must be the beautiful photography -starting with the very first shots of the two lovers- and the deliberate moving away from conventional script writing by Marguerite Dumas.

Death is never easy to explore and it's done here tastefully, gritty, and realistically. Gregory Peck shines in this controversial role. Ava Gardner gives her finest performance. Fred Astaire is incredible in this serious role. However, the film was stolen by the pre-Psycho Anthoney Perkins and newcomer Donna Anderson as a doomed young couple with a new baby.

       " 'For many, Hawks\\' \\'Rio Bravo\\' is the perfect Western... For me it is the antithesis of \\'High Noon,\\' and the clearest exposition of Hawks\\' philosophy of professionalism... His tough lawman solves his own problem without going out looking for help... So he welcomes volunteers and in fact depends on them... What is more, he wins by displaying superior skills and quicker wits...The survivors in Hawks\\' philosophy are the ones who conduct themselves with the greatest degree of coolness and discipline... It is not difficult to appreciate why Hawks has used substantially the \\'Rio Bravo\\' plot, with only minor variations in both his subsequent Westerns, \\'El Dorado\\' and \\'Rio Lobo.\\'In Fred Zinneman\\'s \\'High Noon,\\' Gary Cooper struggles to round up a posse that might help him deal with four desperadoes arriving on a noon train to kill him... In \\\\\"Rio Bravo,\\\\\" John Wayne is faced with a similar situation but takes on the forces of evil in the shape of a gang of local tyrants... Wayne always makes us feel that somehow he\\'ll cope... So when the wagon master Ward Bond asks him if he wants to use any of his men as deputies in fighting Burdette\\'s men, he turns down the offer... Wayne, holding a brutish prisoner Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) on a murder charge, waits for the U.S. marshal to take charge of him... But the prisoner\\'s powerful brother Nathan (John Russell) wants him free and is determined to release him by any method possible...The obvious method is the traditional one\\\\u0097hired gunmen\\\\u0097and, in effect, the sheriff becomes a prisoner himself, in his own town\\\\u0085 But in this instance the lawman is not absolutely without help... The two deputies are a semi-crippled veteran (Walter Brennan) and a pretty hopeless drunk with a past \\'fast\\' reputation (Dean Martin). But the whole point about this cleverly conceived movie is that this unlikely trio do in fact have something to offer when the cards are dealt... Like the sheriff, they\\'re professional people, and what Hawks seems to be saying is that whatever the odds, such people will always have the courage, and the deeds... This is demonstrated in one inspired sequence which has become a classic: Dean Martin \\\\u0096 drying out and eager to win back his self-respect \\\\u0096 tells Chance that he wants to be the one who chase the killer into a saloon, and that Chance should assume the less dangerous role of backing him up from the back door...\\'Rio Bravo\\' is a beautifully controlled film... John Wayne, who re-created and heightened the mythology of the West, is at his best...John Ford imitates Howard Hawks\\' tendency for having his male characters never back down from a fight even when it means they are initiating the fight themselves... In Rio Bravo\\'s famous wordless opening, villain Claude Akins throws a silver dollar into a spittoon, daring Dude, so desperate for a drink, to humiliate himself, and get the coin... Hawks\\' clever camera emphasizes how far beneath the standards Dude has fallen... Now Wayne is ready to confront Akins...The same scene in Ford\\'s \\'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\\' Lee Marvin trips unarmed James Stewart as he carries a steak dinner to Wayne in the restaurant where he works... He stumbles and the steak falls to the ground... Stewart has been obviously humiliated... Suddenly Wayne enters the frame, and orders Valance to peak up \\'his\\' steak, revealing his gun belt as he faces him... He is ready for the showdown...In \\'Rio Bravo,\\' Hawks\\' men win out primarily because they fight together... But Hawks helps them by having the outlaws mistakenly play a Mexican tune called \\'cutthroat,\\' a song which Santa Anna tried to intimidate the Texans under siege in the Alamo... As the music plays, we see Dude putting down his glass untouched... He observes that his hands no longer shake...In Hawks\\' \\'Rio Bravo\\' there is tenderness, and humor... In Hawks\\' film, a man is defined by how well he relates to women, how well he handles pressure and how he reacts to danger... Angie Dickinson playing the gambling gal, enriches the mixture with a nicely judged performance... \\'Rio Bravo\\' is an action Western, which captures a legendary West that fits the legendary talents of Wayne and Hawks... But what makes the film so special is the relationship between the individual characters... It is a traditional, straightforward Western, good-humored and exciting, rich in original touches...The best moment of the film when Martin and Nelson join each other for some singing and guitar picking, and Walter Brennan joins in with his harmonica and his scratchy voice... The film has a terrific score by one of the great film composers Dimitri Tiomkin...',\n",

The ambitious director, Dr. Hockstader, wants to send the young doctor to talk to Mrs. Violet Venable, one of the richest ladies in New Orleans, because she is interested in donating money toward a hospital\\'s improvements, with the caveat that her young niece, Catherine, undergoes the operation. Evidently, she has been \\\\\"babbling\\\\\" all kinds of nonsense and has been diagnosed suffering from schizophrenia.What Mrs. Venable doesn\\'t tell the young doctor is the reason why her niece is acting in such a strange manner. During the visit, she speaks of her dead young son, Sebastian, who died tragically, suddenly, last summer of a heart attack. Violet doesn\\'t go into details, but it seems there is much more to the story than she tells Dr. Cuckrowicz. Mrs. Venable talks about her summer trips with Sebastian and the horrible experience she had in the Galapagos watching the young turtles rushing to the sea falling prey to the predatory black birds that seem to cloud the sky.That there\\'s something more, is clearly noticed by the young doctor when he meets Catherine, the lovely young woman being kept in another hospital\\'s mental ward. Catherine comes across as quite sane, which poses a moral dilemma for the Cukrowicz, who is under pressure to rush Catherine\\'s lobotomy. Since he has so many doubts and in trying to see what\\'s wrong with the girl, he hears about how Catherine and Violet have served as procurers to the late Sebastian.The climax comes as a family reunion in which Dr. Cukrowicz gathers in the Venable mansion\\'s patio all the people involved in the case. It is in this setting that he is able to extract from Catherine\\'s memory what she has kept bottled up there. In a sequence that plays as a film within Catherine\\'s mind, we watch the horrors this young woman went through when the situation gets out of hand between Sebastian and the young men of Cabeza de Lobo, where they had spent part of their vacation.Tennessee Williams, the playwright, and Gore Vidal, the adapter, both spent time in Italy. It\\'s somehow disorienting that Catherine is talking about Amalfi and changes to another location, the scene of what appears to be the martyrdom of Sebastian, paralleling the life of the saint of the same name, to Cabeza de Lobo, which sounds more as being set in Spain than in Italy. Nevertheless, these starving children Sebastian lures to him by using his gorgeous cousin in revealing swimsuit, are key to what happens to him in that shocking day.Katherine Hepburn is about the best thing in the film. She plays a refined and dignified wealthy New Orleans matron with great assurance. Ms. Hepburn gave an understated performance showing a restraint that with some other actress might have develop into caricature. Her Mrs. Venable is a woman whose sorrow for the lost of the son knows no bounds and is trying to shut up the only person that knows the truth about what really happened to him.Elizabeth Taylor makes an invaluable contribution to the film with her luminous portrayal of Catherine. She was seen in the film at the height of her beauty and youth. Ms. Taylor, in one of her best appearances in any film, is convincing as the young woman who has been traumatized by what she had witnessed that fateful summer.Montgomery Clift, who has the lesser part of Dr. Cukrowicz, does what he can with his role. Mercedes McCambridge, on the other hand is perfect as the ambitious poor relative without scruples, who will do anything to receive the crumbs of her richer relative and couldn\\'t care what happens to her daughter.This film was ahead of its times and still packs a lot of power because of the direction of Mr. Mankiewicz and his stellar cast.',\n",
       " \"Written by the great filmmaker Billy Wilder, this is a serious, sardonic comedy for people who've known what's its like to feel the pressure of compromising your principles or your self- respect for the sake of getting ahead in life. And there are very few over the age of consent who haven't had to at one time or another. This isn't the laugh out loud comedy of Jim Carrey or the Farrelly brothers, but a subtle, nuanced comedy about two people who have both been jaded in love and yet continue to hope again and again that it will someday work out for them -- mainly because despite the unlikeable things they do, they are both basically decent, nice people. Flawed and even weak at times, but good people. This is a movie that doesn't just make it you laugh, it makes you think. A rare find indeed.\",\n",
       " \"Billy Wilder knew how to make a great movie. Of course it helps to have one of the greatest all-time actors, Jack Lemon, play in your movies, but Lemon aside, Wilder was a genius. His gift for the comedic moment showed brilliantly on screen and reached deep inside the audience.The Apartment, the last of the great Black and White films, showed a bit darker side to comedy than some of his other romps such as the hilarious Some Like It Hot. Some Like It Hot is just as funny today as it was in 1959. It is pure fun. At no point in the film are we approached with anything that we would take seriously. Let's face it, most of us are not running from the mob disguised as a member from the opposite sex.The Apartment, however, brings up much more human themes and issues. Wilder is an expert and at no time does he leave you worried that it will turn out badly. This is, after all, a comedy. One mistake in the script and the movie could quickly become a deep film about suicide, loneliness, and peer pressure, but Wilder balances the subjects on the edge of a knife and allows us to smile at what could otherwise be a very depressing movie.Wilder and his films like The Apartment are very similar to Shakespeare's comedies. It can be said that the difference between a Shakespeare comedy and tragedy is often not the story, but the ending. In a comedy, everyone is married; in a tragedy, everyone dies. the same is true with The Apartment, it all hinges on the outcomes. If Kubelik dies or Baxter is left alone, the movie would be a tragedy. But since they prevail in the end, the movie comes off as a great comedic success, albeit a bit dark.\",\n",

Marcello Mastroianni is superb, a beautiful exterior with an interior that is dying, slowly but surely. The term \\\\\"paparazzo\\\\\" was coined in this film. The hunters of the banal grew in numbers over the years but not in scope,\\\\nAnita Ekberg became a symbol of the sixties and who was she? A fantasy, impossible to reach. Real is his wife, the splendid Yvonne Fourneaux. Real is his father, played with heart breaking resignation by Annibale Ninchi or the suicide of his close friend, the intellectual played by Alain Cuny.

It beautifully reflects the social values of the time and depicts very well the attitudes of the time in which the movie was set.

       " 'Alfred Hitchock is the master of suspense and Psycho is probably his most famous film. Because, let\\'s face it, one way or another, you have seen or heard of this film. It\\'s been made fun of, been remade(unfortunately), not to mention that this movie\\'s word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young, my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn\\'t want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn\\'t believe them, but when I watched it, I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head, it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made, and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office, now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater, now if you compare that to today, that\\'s Titanic like money! It broke many taboo\\'s, like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed, isn\\'t that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense, I mean, the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won\\'t give spoilers.Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony, they\\'ll get married. When Marion\\'s boss asks her to put their most valued client\\'s money, $40,000 to be exact, and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though, she takes the money for herself and flee\\'s the city, but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough, huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in, and a police officer asks if she\\'s OK, but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.She meets there, the owner, a pleasant and polite young man, Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner, they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well, she says she is going to a \\\\\"private island\\\\\". Norman is very attracted to her, you can tell immediately, and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she\\'s taking a shower before bed, a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.Marion\\'s boyfriend, Sam and her sister, Lola, hire a private detective to find her. The private detective comes across The Bates Motel and doesn\\'t end up coming back after trying to \\\\\"talk\\\\\" to the mother. Lola and Sam are concerned and decide to investigate for themselves, but will they end up coming back to the city alive? Psycho is just one of those movies you have to see before you die. It\\'s one of the most important films of our time and will never be forgotten. It\\'s a true treasure with terrific actors and a terrifying plot that will give you nightmares for weeks! Please don\\'t let that scare you, I\\'m just having fun, but it is a freaky film! Watch it in the dark! It has a better effect, I think.

       " 'Widely acclaimed for his serious ambitions and his uncompromising perfectionism, Stanley Kubrick has won for himself a unique degree of artistic freedom...Based on a true story of a slave revolt in 73 B.C., Dalton Trumbo\\'s script mixes the melodrama with some quite moving moments... The film depicts the Roman era, the brutality of the slave system, gladiator combat and the decadence of Roman senators... What emerges from the screen is a passionate statement on behalf of freedom and men who are willing to die to overthrow oppressive governments...The credit for the film\\'s style belongs to Stanley Kubrick, who handles scenes of intimacy and scenes of gigantic sweep with equal attention, illustrating the violence, brutality and corruption of both, the masters and the slaves, raising the question of freedom which justify the human cost...Kirk Douglas plays Spartacus the idealistic noble slave who believes he must struggle forever against tyranny and just by opposing tyranny he inspires his followers with his example...Spartacus\\' character, from a violent primitive rebel who hamstrung a foreman with his teeth, into a gladiator who fought desperately for life in the arena, into a revolutionary able to unite an amorphous mass of slaves and deserters, into a force which succeeded to defeat Rome\\'s best trained armies, into a charismatic leader (with a vision) who forces a long-awaited revolt against the Roman empire...Two political rivals (Crassus and Gracchus) use the slave uprising threat to manipulate the Roman senate for their own ends: Crassus (played powerfully by Laurence Olivier) extorts \\'a fee,\\' the dictatorial post of First Consul, Commander of all the legions of Italy as his price for releasing Rome from Spartacus... Crassus sees the defeat of Spartacus\\' army as a chance for him to seize power of the empire for himself... He tries to make the slaves betray Spartacus... He tries to win the love of Varinia, not merely to possess her, but as a form of victory over Spartacus... In his last confrontation with Spartacus, he is seen losing all his delusions of grandeur as he stands deeply wounded by the total disregard in which Spartacus holds him...Charles Laughton plays, with expertise, Gracchus, a generous Roman politician, soft and rich, able to get his Julius Caesar (John Gavin) elected leader of the Praetorian Guard to annoy Crassus\\' ambitions...The first hour of \\\\\"Spartacus\\\\\" contains many of the film\\'s best moments : The operation of the gladiatorial school and its training program is impressive and also expressive... The gladiators school is tough but fair: The men are oiled, bathed, shaved, massaged and trained to fight... They are never allowed to kill... And for their good performances, they are even rewarded with the companionship of a young lady... In this degrading manner Spartacus meets Varinia (Jean Simmons-lovely as ever) and it is his love for her and his hatred for his captors that inadvertently sparks off an uprising and the gladiators break out...Particularly effective is the scene in which Crassus and his \\\\\"capricious over-painted nymphs\\\\\" (Nina Foch &amp; Joanna Barnes) ask to be entertained by the sight of two pairs fighting to the death... The scene summarizes the injustice of the situation, the cruelty of bondage and the insurrection becomes a triumph easy to understand...Nominated for six Academy Awards, and winning for Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction and Supporting Actor\\\\u0097Peter Ustinov. the motion picture contains no chariot races and no orgies but it still imparts the grandeur and the decay of ancient Rome...

       " 'I happened to read the short novel by Kennaway before seeing its movie-version \\\\\"Tunes of Glory\\\\\". The novel is good, but, quite uncommonly, the film is much better, which is mainly due to the stunning excellence of acting. For instance, reading the book I wasn\\'t quite convinced by the final mental collapse of Jock Sinclair: with his beyond-any-possible-praise performance, Alec Guinness made me wholly understand the deep inner sufferings of the outwardly friendly, tough, rash Scottish officer.The story is very simple, few things happens. The film is almost entirely located in the barracks of a Highlanders regiment. Here we find a (somewhat conventional) clash between the lower-class major Jock Sinclair and the upper-class colonel Barrow (John Mills), who suddenly replaces Jock in the command of the regiment. Jock has started as a simple piper, and has gained his grades on the battle-field during World War II. We gather that he is a natural born soldier-hero, with the typical virtues but also with the defects of natural born heroes, for instance a certain lack of intelligence and sensitiveness. For Jock the war was just a stimulating, if tough, adventure, where he had the opportunity to test his courage and honor. Barrow comes from the Military Academy, and has much more education, manners, and, perhaps, intelligence than Jock. And, by sure, he wholly and bravely accomplished his duties during the war, but we see that, differently from the light-hearted Jock, the horrors of the war have left deep traces in his mind, which increased his natural excitability to a breaking-point. He deeply feels the grief of being looked at as an intruder by the tight community of the other officers.In the movie we find many subtleties on military life. The attachment to the Highlanders tradition is symbolized by the officers\\' use of calling each other by first name and of drinking whisky: in this sense, important is the scene when a false friend refuses Jock\\'s offer of a glass of whisky, and takes gin, instead. We realize that this impoliteness is not a trifle as it may seem. John Mills is superb in his design of Barrow, and he\\'s only surpassed by Guinness. But the whole cast is fantastic. How good is the \\\\\"average\\\\\" British actor is always amazing for me. Alec Guinness for me is the greatest actor of all times. He doesn\\'t act: he IS Jock Sinclair, as he was the myriad of other characters he BECAME during his glorious career. He is so good that, after all, I think that he was underrated, despite his fame. Rest in peace, great Sir Alec, and thank you for all. A final remark. I read somewhere that many British critics and directors, not least Alfred Hitchcock, have considered \\\\\"Tunes of Glory\\\\\" the best movie ever made. Indeed, even an Italian as myself can feel that this magnificent film touches some profound chords of the British soul.',\n",
       " 'Years come and go, but \\\\\"Marienbad\\\\\" seems to remain the same--intriguing, challenging, stimulating, and moving.  Alain Resnais\\' classic emerges as a timeless work, with a memorable score (utilizing unique pipe organ music) by Francis Seyrig and striking photography by Sacha Vierny.  Delphine Seyrig and Giorgio Albertazzi play out their \\\\\"roles\\\\\" amidst dark corridors, empty halls, baroque statuary and geometric gardens.  Time seems to stand still in the world of Resnais and Alain Robbe-Grillet, as our rapt attention is focused on its distinctive unfoldment.  The meaning seems to be in the work and the solution in the problem. We simply take it in and allow it to speak for itself. \\\\\"Marienbad\\\\\" is one of those films which requires a full- size widescreen and an excellent print to weave its haunting magic.

       " 'Older people tell us that as you age, time seems to speed up and fly quickly bye. Watch \\\\\"The Beast of Yucca Flats\\\\\" and you will observe a paradox \\\\u0096 you will age rapidly, yet time will slow to a crawl, the 54 minute running time feeling like hours, or even days.The plot of this movie may be summarized as follows. A scientist is converted into a monster when exposed to a nuclear test. He kills an unlucky (and very unobservant) couple whose car had broken down, and then chases two young boys around while their father is trying to fix a flat tire. Two lawmen on the trail of the beast shoot, first the father of the boys, and then the beast, after which a rabbit stumbles into the scene and nuzzles the beast causing it to grab and kiss the rabbit before succumbing at last to its wounds. Actually, this is not a plot summary, but rather the shooting script, with the exception of the rabbit, which was a wild rabbit that stumbled into the scene entirely by accident, and was left in. There are no outtakes in a Coleman Francis movie.This was the first effort by then unknown filmmaker Coleman Francis. Francis was thus unexposed when the film was shot, though in a more perfect world, the film would have been unexposed and Coleman Francis shot. In this film, Francis pays homage to Hitchcock with a scene reminiscent of the cropduster sequence in North by Northwest, and to Ed Wood, by intercutting freely between day and night during a chase scene. Francis\\' talent as a filmmaker really shines, however, in his decision to dispense with synchronized sound as might have been utilized by a lesser filmmaker. He does this in several clever ways, such as having dialog (and gunshots) come from off screen, or by having the actors cover their mouths or turn their faces away from the camera when they speak. In one particularly inspired sequence, he simply frames the top of the camera view to the actors\\' shoulders, letting the dialog crackle back and forth between the headless bodies.Kudos must also go to the cast. Conrad Brooks, of Plan 9 fame, appears in this film, which launched him into a long and illustrious career in such beloved classics as \\\\\"Polish Vampire in Burbank,\\\\\" \\\\\"Fart: the Movie,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Zombiegeddon.\\\\\" Tor Johnson, who had similarly appeared in Plan 9, also experienced a career advancement after this film -- he never made another movie. Despite the notable work by these two, as well as several friends and relatives of the director, special mention must be made of the rabbit, which turned in by far the best performance of the movie, displaying great charisma and screen presence, while still seeming natural and unaffected. To achieve all of this while being unexpectedly kissed by Tor Johnson is no mean feat for a first-timer.This film shames the recently popular movie \\\\\"The Ring,\\\\\" in which everyone who watches a certain video all die horrible deaths within one week of the viewing. \\\\\"The Beast of Yucca Flats\\\\\" effortlessly achieves the same result in just 54 minutes.',\n",

However, he produced three films which deserve  a permanent place  among the classics, All the Kings Men( probably the best film about American politics), Lilith( one of the greatest films about mental illness) and this, a movie which DESERVES to be ranked with the hundred greatest, and possibly the fifty greatest, American films. It is superbly acted, brilliantly photographed and edited, and directed with clarity and assurance. In a just world ( if there is such a place), an special Oscar would have been bestowed on Newman, Laurie, Scott, and Gleason AS A GROUP. Piper Laurie was unforgettably poignant, Scott unforgettably sleazy, and Gleason... well, Gleason simply IS Minnesota Fats. Paul Newman almost certainly deserved the Oscar.It was  an amusing irony, perhaps a little joke by God, that the bartender in the movie was played by none other than Jake LaMotta.',\n",
       " 'Jack Clayton\\'s sensitivity proves it, there is no need of blood and disgust to make a good creepy thriller! I saw many films in my life and I learned to love Bergman, Kubrick, Kieslowski, Leone, Allen, but I really believe that I enjoyed no other film as much as \\\\\"The Innocents\\\\\"! Outstanding cast and outstanding photographed! The music of Georges Auric is perfect (included an old death-yearning song \\\\\"O willow waly\\\\\"). If you ever go for a trip to England, go and see the wonderful location \\\\\"Sheffield Park Garden in Sussex\\\\\". This is not only an intelligent and incredible atmospheric film, it is a weird journey into a spiritual world. And perhaps Clayton\\'s direction went too far, because unfortunately this gem never found an audience! After a novel \\\\\"The turn of the screw\\\\\" by Henry James. One more tip, if you ever have the chance to see this Cinemascope-film in a movie theater, do it! It really is overwhelming!!!',\n",
       " 'Why do so many people need to \\\\\"get into the characters\\\\\" \\\\\"care about the characters\\\\\" \\\\\"identify with the characters\\\\\", to enjoy or appreciate a great film? I think it\\'s a type of selfishness, as shallow as the urge to reject an outcome one doesn\\'t like. Examples: \\\\\"I know it\\'s good; but the ending was too down\\\\\" (Lolita), or a woman I once heard criticize Unbearable Lightness of Being because one of the main characters is a womanizer who doesn\\'t repent or have justice rendered to him. Ironically, in Jules and Jim, we see a woman who is a \\\\\"manizer\\\\\" whom some viewers are appalled or put off by). Jules and Jim features three characters whose unrealism is beyond question - Truffaut himself might comment on how Catherine fascinated the other two, but I doubt very much he would claim any of the three to be \\\\\"realistic\\\\\". I think the whole thing is a fable, and therefore the three are more like archetypes. The beauty isn\\'t really the story, but HOW the story unfolds, and, most importantly how it is told VISUALLY: the breeziness interrupted by dramatic outbursts (flames, jumping into the river, death by drowning), the exploration of love as a fleeing of tediousness and predictability, the hinting (yes there is a type of love between Jules and Jim, though not a homo erotic one) that friendship is always deeper than romantic love, the beautiful flowing and editing of sequences, for example: where all three go bicycling in the country. The duty of film is to tell a story in moving images, to take advantage of the things that specifically make cinema different from drama or literature - moving the spectator about in space and time, which cannot be done in any other art form in quite the same way. But nothing about this movie is conventional, and people looking for \\\\\"resolution\\\\\", or a someone getting their comeuppances, or even a character learning more about himself must look elsewhere for gratification.',\n",
       " 'This is a one of a kind film experience which has taken on even more depth with our hindsight into the lives of its creators. Written by Monroe\\'s then husband, Arthur Miller, and produced as their marriage was ending, it provides Monroe with the role of her life. There are many great moments in the film, the most famous being her tirade against the cruelty and dishonesty of the men in her life.  You will never forget her cries of \\\\\"Murderers!\\\\\" , even more horrifying now, given the suspicions surrounding her death. But for me the most unforgettable moment takes place in the cab of the truck when Eli Wallach\\'s character offers to save the lives of some horses if she will give up the man she is with and live with him. The look on her face changes from hope to horror as she realizes he\\'s bartering the horses\\' lives for hers: \\\\\"You have to GET something in order to act human?!\\\\\" she spits out at him. It\\'s a great script, cast perfectly, and speaks as sadly and as eloquently to us now as it did forty years ago.',\n",

Oddly enough, we never get to see his face, and no insight is given of his character or about how and why did he turn into such an icon for the sicilian people. We only know about him through the other characters in the film. Even though there is some fine acting going on, the direction of Mr.Rosi is downright awful. We are presented with a series of events with no connecting thread whatsoever, other than a logical chronological development. While dealing with an interesting historical moment of Sicily, the film is terribly boring and you need a truckload of patience to stay tuned through the end. If you are keen on studying Sicily\\'s historical heritage, you may find this film interesting, if not, then you should miss it!.',\n",

In \\\\\"West Side Story\\\\\" we visit Romeo And Juliet in New York among feuding street gangs. Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins create an experience for the ages.

The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft.\",\n",

They also kept the focus on the bravery of the Spartans, and that all of Greece not only wished them well, but could help, as with the Athenian fleet, not some CGI generated storm.This was also marked by good acting all around, from Richard Egan as Leonidas, and all the supporting cast.

To see it now after two decades is a whole other story - All of a sudden James Mason's Humbert Humbert has become human, very human. Corrupt and haunted by the awareness of his own weakness. What a performance. Shelley Winters is superb, unafraid and bold bringing to life an embarrassing human spectacle. What a performance. Peter Sellers is chilling in all of his Quilty incarnations.

When Mr Lean wanted to capture a sun rise, he stood in the dark (in a REAL desert) and waited for the sun to REALLY rise (No computerized nonsense in this film). As for the reviewer who thought Lawrence looked like a homosexual because he had a 'effeminate' walk, well ... I can only hope that one day he joins the 21st century; hero's aren't all musclebound apes, leaders aren't all fluffy paragons of virtue, and so what if he did turn out to be homosexual?If you and you dad like watching a man being whipped before being violated there is, I believe, a wealth of material available to cater for your taste at your local pornography shop.In my opinion its one of the best films ever made and certainly the best film I've seen based on real events.Forget the length feel the quality.\",\n",

       " '\\'The Longest Day\\' is June 6, 1944, the day the Allied assault on Hitler\\'s Fortress Europe... And when it came everything went much according to plan... But fighting through the tough country of Normandy took much longer than had been expected...Dwight D. Eisenhower, the four-star Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, made up the force of some two million men massed in England for the strike at Europe...Combined American, British, Irish and Canadian forces assault the beaches of Normandy in an effort to gain a foothold on the continent... From the viewpoint of the Americans and Germans involved, the story unfolds through numerous episodes highlighting the \\'Longest Day.\\' We see the commands posts occupied by the Germans; Caen, the starting point; the French underground network; Omaha Beach; Utah Beach; Ste-M\\\\u00e8re-\\\\u00c9glise; as well as sites and camps in England...The film is a clear examination of D-Day looked at from almost every viewpoint, particularly from that of the Germans who are overwhelmed by the forces brought against them... It is in fact Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (profiled against the French beach thoroughly planted with mined obstacles) who looks out to where the invasion fleet will appear later-or sooner, and gives the film its title: \\\\\"The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive... For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day.\\\\\"In the first half, much attention is focused on the weather, as the troops... American, British, Irish, Canadian and French are poised on board their boats and ships, waiting for the rain to stop... In the key scene when Gen. Eisenhower (David Grace), makes the decision to go ahead with the invasion on June 6, more than 5,000 ships moved to assigned positions... The importance of time is emphasized by increasing the ticking of a clock... On the other side of the channel, the German generals, who know the invasion is imminent, see the same nasty weather and decide to take some time off for war games...French Resistance fighters receive their coded instructions from BBC radio and increase their sabotage activities... Much of the early going is also devoted to some of the Allies\\' more unorthodox ideas, the kinds of things that make more sense cinematic ally than militarily: the use of metal clickers by paratroopers for identification, and parachuting mechanical dummies loaded with firecrackers behind German lines to create confusion...The film reaches its peak when the two sides in the battle are finally engaged...The first assault wave hit the Normandy beaches at 6:30 A.M. on June 6... The soil of France looked sordid and uninviting... Planning has been as complete as possible, but in the vast confusion of invasion under enemy fire, so many men fell uselessly when they left their landing craft, and stepped into water... Others fell into underwater shell craters and drowned...The Allied air bombing that was to have knocked out German beach defense guns had not been accurate, especially on Omaha Beach where the bombs had been laid down too far inland to do much good... As a result, the gunfire that met American troops there was more murderous than anything they had been prepared for..Today it is difficult to watch the invasion scenes and not compare them to the opening of Steven Spielberg\\'s \\'Saving Private Ryan,\\' but that really is unfair... Zanuck manages to display the image of thousands of young soldiers who were killed fighting to liberate France... A long aerial shot from the point of view of a German pilot Josef \\'Pips\\' Priller (Heinz Reincke) strafing Normandy Beach reveals a shore-line of successive waves of men running for their lives trying to secure Omaha Beach... This awful waste and destruction of war: scores of trucks and boats hit by shells, or sunk by mines with their crew lost... Trucks overturned and swamped, partly sunken barges, and many jeeps half submerged... Field Marshal Rommel set to work to do everything possible to make the beaches if not impregnable, very uninviting indeed... \\'The war will be won or lost on the beaches,\\' he states... The German command was slow to react to the invasion... They had been misled by the weather and the Allied deception plan that Normandy was a diversion and the main landing would be at Pas-de-Calais...Shot in CinemaScope and in black-and-white, \\'The Longest Day\\' captures the history of the moment... The film tracks the book very closely, shifting the viewpoints from German to French to American to British throughout... In three hours Zanuck and his staff expand on the scope of one day, to tell mostly everything, with an exceptionally strong cast playing cameo roles... The cast could not be better, in spite of the brevity of their roles: Bourvil is the French Mayor of Colleville who welcomes the British soldiers with a bottle of champagne...Irina Demick is Janine Boitard, the sexy good-looking Resistance member...Henry Fonda is Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Brigadier General who limps ashore with the first of the assault boats landing on Utah Beach...Christian Marquand is Philippe Kieffer, the French Commander in desperate situation in Ouistreham...Robert Mitchum is Norman Cota, the Brigadier general who chops on his cold cigar, and walks along the beach and rallies his men... Mitchum gets some great lines and delivers them with the right amount of idealism and cynicism...Richard Todd is John Howard, the major who lands by glider at B\\\\u00e9nouville to capture the canal bridge over the Orne River...All the characters speak in their own languages... The motion picture is Winner of two Academy Awards for Cinematography and Special Effects, Zanuck\\'s \\'The Longest Day\\' is one without doubt an absolutely remarkable film, one of the most impressive and most authentic documentation of war ever put on film...',\n",

It\\'s also, if I\\'m permitted to say it, a lot of fun to watch. Strangely enough the all star cast is not distracting at all. It was much more in \\\\\"Saving Private Ryan\\\\\" with a cast of up and comings headed by Tom Hanks himself. In \\\\\"The Longest Day\\\\\" there are real moments, film, cinematic moments that are intimately connected with the profoundest sense of drama: The clicking of the rifle.

It\\'s triggered off, and that\\'s the right phrase, as it turns out, by flashback... The old device works well in the hands of the master... In fact, John Ford couldn\\'t have got the feeling he\\'s after in any other way... Ford seems to be mourning the Old West... It\\'s a mixed feeling\\\\u0097composed of pride, regret, and a sense of the inherent injustice of life, and certain forebodings about the future...When a famous elderly Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart), looking every inch the revered veteran political figure, gets off a train at a small Western town with his good lady (Vera Miles) you can tell by the way his eye roves for and rests on bits of time remembered that this is very much a sentimental journey\\\\u0085 He\\'s come to pay his last respects to a friend of the long, long ago\\\\u0097a small rancher in those days, played by John Wayne...Dissolve into the distant story\\\\u0097presenting young tenderfoot lawyer Stewart, eagerly intent on bringing Eastern law-books to bear on the problems of the West\\\\u0085 His first taste of the West is a sound beating up, by a man called Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who is a gunman employed by powerful cattlemen who oppose statehood for the Territory...Nor does Ranse find any real custom even among the law-abiding... He starts his career, in fact, as a kitchen hand in a caf\\\\u00e9 where he\\'s been taken by Tom Doniphon (Wayne) following his nasty experience with Liberty... Ford is at his \\'domestic\\' best in this caf\\\\u00e9 which is run by a Swedish pair (John Qualen and Jeannette Nolan) and where Ranse\\'s wife-to-be is one of the employees... Stewart, wearing an apron contrasted with Wayne, pure frontiersman, is something to see in that kitchen... And there\\'s always an edge to their meetings...It isn\\'t hard to guess that before long the waitress, Tom\\'s girl, is going to fail for the injured tenderfoot who takes on her education... Ranse eventually hangs up his sign in the office of the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, a typical \\'character\\', played by Edmond O\\'Brien, and from then on it\\'s the story of a territory growing up and seeking statehood, with Ranse Stoddard maturing, too, as the natural leader of \\'civilized\\' law and order aspirations...But none of it could have happened without the removal of Liberty Valance... Ranse confronts him and the bullets fly but the bullet that actually drops him comes from another Winchester in the shadows... Ranse goes to Washington on the strength of ridding the territory of Liberty Valance, but he knows that the shot was fired by another man\\\\u0085 It\\'s another film about the right man being in the right place at the right time in order to advance the course of Western civilization... Skillful, undoubtedly, but in this case the right man never gets his just deserts\\\\u0097if he ever wanted them, because the Wayne character in his way is just as much a part of the Old West as Marvin...Herein lies the bitter essence of the film... Wayne, at heart, is as contemptuous of what Stewart stands for\\\\u0097talk and conferences and thick legal tomes as the gunman is\\\\u0085 And through him you feel Ford saying that the hard men who had it the hardest on the frontier are soon forgotten, and some of the frontier\\'s simple virtues have been buried with them\\\\u0085\\\\\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\\\\" is honest, unpretentious and deeply moving... In no other Ford Western does the audience feel so involved... The playing is brilliant\\\\u0097from the smallest role to the beautifully interpreted ambivalent relationship of Wayne and Stewart...Their acting style are quite different... Stewart had developed a standard repertoire of mannerisms that his public had come to cherish... Wayne\\'s style was spare, clean and unadorned; he stood tall, very much himself... Certainly this film exemplifies a wonderful blending of three great talents, Ford\\'s, Stewart\\'s, and Wayne\\'s, and their seamless mutual chemistry is one of the salient aspect of it...',\n",
       " 'John Ford\\'s 1962 film, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, is an ode to the end of the classic western. It is a satiric look at the civilizing of the once wild American west where Ford deliberately uses stereotypical characters and situations to undermine and reexamine the very myths that he helped create. Ford\\'s world is one of moral certainty and untamed villainy where legends are born and cowboy heroes ride free amidst the broad natural landscapes of America\\'s West. In the west of Liberty Valance, the hero is not made nor born, but manufactured by the media. As the editor of the Shinbone Star says; \\\\\"This is the West. When the legend becomes the fact, print the legend.\\\\\"The legend concerns lawyer Ransom Stoddard, played in typical earnest aw-shucks fashion by Jimmy Stewart. Stoddard has been brought, bruised and beaten, to the western town of Shinbone following an altercation with a gang of stagecoach highwaymen, led by arch-villain Liberty Valance. As played by Lee Marvin, Valance is deadpan and over-the top evil. His uncompromising performance is one of the pleasures of the film. With his lethal black whip and his giggling and glowering henchmen (played by Strother Martin and Lee VanCleef), Marvin is unabashedly nasty and taunting at every turn. His nemesis is that stalwart icon of the heroic west, John Wayne as Tom Doniphan. His code of honor is as solid as his skill with a six-gun. Doniphan knows that might rules the west, and will inevitably vanquish evil. But Stoddard\\'s mission is to see that justice is done through the more civilized rule of law. Of his nemesis Valance, Stoddard says; \\'I don\\'t want to kill him, I just want to put him in jail!\\' Not likely, in John Ford\\'s west.Into the mix come a parade of character actors whose vivid stereotypes have enlivened westerns for decades: Edmond O\\'Brien as the drunken but noble newspaper editor; Andy Devine as the whimpering, good-hearted, but cowardly sheriff; Woody Strode as the silent, noble black man, backbone of the west; and last and most essential is Vera Miles as Hallie, for whose heart our heroes compete. It is in that romantic triangle that the real heart of west may be won. In this way the Hallie, like the cactus rose she carries to Doniphan\\'s funeral, becomes a bittersweet symbol for the loss and the hope of the new west.Ford makes Liberty Valance into a western that seems to examine itself as a western. He removes the window dressing to focus on the intricate play of characters and symbols. Gone is the Technicolor of the Searchers. This is in stark black and white. Gone are the outdoor landscapes of Ford\\'s west. Most of the film looks like it was on the back lot, and many scenes take place indoors. He moves his camera in on faces not vistas. The world of 1960\\'s America was changing and beginning to reexamine the usefulness of certain cultural mythologies. The new decade was about people; the grand ideals of postwar America were being reexamined and were about to become even dimmer with the assassination of President Kennedy. America was beginning to be about recognizing unique individualities, about embracing change, about individual rights, strong women, sensitive men. Ford didn\\'t like that much, I imagine. The film\\'s characters are flawed and cartoonish. I suspect his film was a wry satire on his own mythology and a critique of what he viewed as a softening of American society. Some critics didn\\'t get it, while others consider this one of his more remarkable films. There is no doubt that it is nothing short of brilliant the ability to balance the elements of satire and seriousness, comedy and melodrama.As the train leaves Shinbone, the truth forever gives way to the legend. The conductor leans over to light Stoddard\\'s cigar saying; \\'Nothing is too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.\\' In that moment we are incredibly moved. This is, after all, about the creation of stories. But in those stories there live truths about human nature that are universal and forever.',\n",
       " \"Time is the ultimate judge, isn't that what they say? Well 1962's The Manchurian Candidate is all the evidence I need. It feels ahead of it's time still and so relevant. In 2004, Jonathan Demme - one of my heroes - remade it with Meryl Streep - one my favorites - and Denzel Washington - one of my favorites - and the whole thing felt so old hat that I had to see John Frankeihemer's 1962 version again. Wow! Angela Lansbury creates one of the greatest villains in movie history. She is phenomenal and like it happens she's the kind of monster you can't have enough of. Frank Sinatra is really good here and the creepiness of Laurence Harvey is unsurpassed. So, well, yes, time has confirmed and protected the greatness of this outrageous thriller.\",\n",
       " 'By the dawn of the 60s America had not been through with McCarthy-ism, the Korean War, and Communist witch hunts when it was already aiming towards a Cold War situation and ultimately, Vietnam. So much plays into this movie which came out at exactly the right time and place that even years later, layers of subtext can be garnered from its paranoiac, frightening images.Power is a deadly thing to deal with, especially when it falls into the hands that should have it the least, and the word seems to dominate every angle of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE like a glowing ball of fire. The power to control minds and bend them to darker wills. The power to control the people into believing what the powers-that-be want. The power to demolish anything or anyone considered an even remote obstacle. The power to seize power, extend it outward, blindly, into a waiting globe.And so does this disturbing, dark tale of the search for power in the political world takes place, with some of the most indelible images ever transferred onto the face of cinema. Frankenheimer amps up the paranoia already oozing from the story and with some truly nightmarish sequences brings forth a Creation that always seems like it will disclose some hideous, unseen force playing behind the scene -- the deceptive hydrangea scene at the beginning of the movie and the train scene where a shaken Sinatra meets Leigh who seems to be sincere are two very uneasy sequences to follow through, for example, because both disorient and succeed in sticking needles of doubt into your mind in more ways than one. You know something is completely wrong here and what lies beneath is always unsettling than what is eventually uncovered.This is a character study as well as a political satire: while there is plenty of tension throughout, deep characterizations come through, and needless it is to me to state Angela Lansbury\\'s terrifying performance as Mrs. Iselin, or Laurence Harvey\\'s chilling portrait of a non-entity, a victim and a puppet who\\'s design is to serve as a killing machine and a false hero. Much can be also said of Janet Leigh\\'s Rosie, since her part suggests she also knows and is more than what she reveals, but sadly the film drops what might have been an interesting side story from the moment she appears on the train and talks in that coded language. It seems she only serves to be Sinatra\\'s \\\\\"controller.\\\\\" As for Sinatra himself, he\\'s an asset and a weakness. He\\'s too old to be Laurence Harvey\\'s equal in combat, and his persona often comes through, but he does tune in a measured performance as the damaged General Marco.MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is one of those stories that detail the loss of innocence in America (with its killing of the more honest Senator Thomas Jordan and his almost pure daughter Josie, done without music, but in two long takes) and its transition to a super-power bent on political domination, and it chills to the bone to see it still today, 42 years later.',\n",
       " 'I haven\\'t seen acting like this in a long time! Patty Duke\\'s portrayal of young Helen Keller shocked me with its intensity, rightness, and sensitivity. Anne Bancroft also played a tough role and did so brilliantly.The other supporting roles were, of course, a bit stilted in the traditional Southern way, but added to the drama nonetheless. I still gave this movie a \\\\\"10\\\\\" despite having issues with the way director Penn handled the flashback scenes...a bit cheesy and not quite in keeping with the underlying plot in all cases. That said, the dinner scene with Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft is 100%+ riveting in a way seldom seen and the movie deserves its accolades just for that scene alone.',\n",
       " 'This movie made a strong impression on me when I saw it on Tv as a lad and I have revisted it a few more times but it had been a decade since i saw it last and my daughter had a done a book report on Helen Keller recently and was very moved by her story and I mentioned the Miracle Worker, so we rented it and viewed it tonight and it still packs a wallop and the performances are first rate. Patty Duke won the best supporting oscar that year and deserved it (even though she beat out Mary Badham who played Scout in To Kill A Mockingbird -- what a year for young actresses!!!)and Anne Bancroft is amazing as the tough, determined Anne Sullivan.

       " \"Even for those who generally do not appreciate Westerns, 'Ride the High Country' is an absorbing and moving piece of entertainment... For Western buffs it is an item of study, with its accurate period detail and the vistas of the California Sierras, near Mammoth Lakes... The film firmly established Peckinpah as a director of unusual style, a man with the ability to create strange images, often ugly ones in beautiful settings, although his talent in staging scenes of violence is shockingly impressive...Peckinpah's mining community in this film is memorable for its spirited and dangerous atmosphere, with its one true gold mine being the whorehouse... The madam is a cheerful nightmare, and hidden in a corner is a drunken judge (Edgar Buchanan), with a bottle of whiskey, who comes alive only to remind us that people change... 'Ride the High Country' gets additional poignancy from its choice of stars... They made so many Westerns over the years, and they had long been personal friends\\\\u0085 It was the happiest inspiration that got them together for this afterglow ride that resulted in two unforgettable performances\\\\u0085 But one wonders exact1y how they savor the situation\\\\u0097that after so much riding, over so many years, it has taken a late, almost afterthought ride, to place them securely among Western immortals\\\\u0085 It is, indeed, a happy finale to a pleasing career and a nostalgic reminder of the simple virtues and values of the more traditional Western heroes...Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott had come to specialize in many fine westerns, set an admirable style in quiet heroism, always courageous, ever dignified, never vulgar... They ride this time together, ruminating over times that used to be... Both are heroic figures, having been noted lawmen, and yet they are now reduced to taking whatever comes their way in order to live...One is a man of moral rectitude who believes in fulfilling his obligations, 'doing the job' just like in his old days as lawman... The other out to make one last haul in order to retire with a measure of comfort... But both are old-timers striving to make ends meet in a changing West where they no longer belong... They are clearly past it\\\\u0097McCrea goes into a washroom so that he will not be seen putting on spectacles in order to read a contract; Scott asks his captor to cut him loose for the night, offering only one reason: 'I don't sleep so good anymore.' Both sleep in long combs and pause on a tiring journey to bathe their aching feet in a cold stream... And in the end they defend the old values against the new with pride, dignity, never forgotten their skill with six-guns...'Ride the High Country' had a number of interesting sub-plots and characters and an earthy but tasteful approach to sex... Its strength, however, lay in the sincere and moving portrayals of its two major stars, and in the beauty and poignancy of its final scene...The basic theme of the movie is strong, moving and valid, but, above all, it is the elegiac feel that makes it such a memorable motion picture\\\\u0097the serious thoughts of two veterans about 'how it was.'These are men with tired feet, caught up in the turn of the times... They are still there in the afterglow period of Western history...

       " \"The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  It shows up on screen in every single frame.  Each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch.  As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task.  So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna.  Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced. It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  It paid off in every way imaginable.  None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted.  It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.  She is a product of not only the times in which she lives, but even more so of her wretched upbringing.  Mayella is what she is, but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her.  To Mayella, being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations, is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.\\\\nIn his screen debut as Boo Radley, Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem, Dill, and Scout so much. Though on the screen for a short length of time, without uttering a word, Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty, mistreatment, and the gossip and whispers of neighbors.  He is a man who wants only to live in his own way, yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant.  They are the childhood he had never really known.  Just as Tom Robinson, he has never brought harm to anyone, yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert.  They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen, especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house, the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone, and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play. Elmer Bernstein's score is never boisterous, but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.There have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about To Kill A Mockingbird. Many of the words are far better than those that I have written.  Then again, maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that To Kill A Mockingbird is.  It will be forever remembered, long after you and I have departed from this world.  It is at this point that I usually grade a film. I will skip that here, simply because there is no grade that I can give that could possibly do justice for To Kill A Mockingbird.\",\n",
       " 'After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book\\'s spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it\\'s interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would\\'ve shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book\\'s counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book\\'s early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a \\\\\"must-see,\\\\\" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10',\n",
       " '\\\\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\\\\" is truly a much loved and critically-acclaimed film. It is a perfect portrayal of childhood innocence, racial prejudice, moral tolerance and courage. No other words can describe this film except marvellous. The film is so wonderfully done that the audience actually feels as if they were in Alabama during the 1930s. This is a must see for anyone of any age.',\n",
       " 'Supposedly, this is one of the \\\\\"greatest films of all time\\\\\". Whenever I hear this, I can guarantee that I will hate the movie. This holds true for TKAM. I have tried watching this movie over and over again, hoping that I will \\\\\"get\\\\\" what all the hype is about. I don\\'t. I\\'m sorry. It has to be one of the most boring, slow moving movies ever.I don\\'t understand why this movie, On The Waterfront, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, and Citizen Cane are purported to be such super-duper films. I think they\\'re all tripe.Sorry, folks. Maybe I\\'ll like these films in my next life, but I certainly hate them in this one.',\n",

Maybe you think I'm young and I don't know a classic when I see it, but I do know this isn't a classic. If you want to watch a classic watch Casablanca there's a movie to watching that's a classic. Or Aresnic and The Old Lace there's a great movie too. Horrible acting the only reason to watch the movie is to see who plays that deranged neighbor. I'd like to give specifics why I don't like it but I haven't read it in a while but I do know I couldn't stand the book. Then again people thought the Lord of the Rings was a good movie. I don't' get it, it was sooooooo boring I fell asleep in the first one. The second one was more action packed but still wasn't the best movie I've ever seen.\",\n",
       " 'There is more to this film, in terms of its story, than a woman\\'s descent into prostitution.  To a large extent, it is the story of Godard\\'s failing relationship with Karina.  Or perhaps it presents Godard\\'s overall view of the director\\'s relationship to the actress, the artist\\'s relationship to his subject.Possible spoilers.Aside from Nana, there are three characters crucial to the story: the photographer, the pimp, and the guy who reads excerpts from Poe.  There are two particularly telling scenes: Nana\\'s viewing of Joan of Arc and the subtle appearance of the Elizabeth Taylor photograph behind Nana as the Poe story is read to her.First, the photographer.  He offers Nana her last chance at an entrance into films.  Soon after their meeting she falls into prostitution.  He resembles the pimp in manner.  Are films and prostitution the same?  Rather, are the director and the pimp the same?The real representation of the director is the guy who reads the Poe story. In fact, he represents Godard himself.  This is the guy who buys Nana cigarettes, and when we see Nana consorting with him after all of her degrading experiences, it is like a breath of fresh air.  He is going to glorify her and raise her to the status that she deserves.  He is an artist and he portrays her (\\\\\"This is our story,\\\\\" he says of the Poe story.  \\\\\"An artist portraying his love.\\\\\").  The Poe excerpt ends with the death of the artist\\'s love, his subject.  He drained the life from her and into the canvas.  If this is their story, is the guy draining the life from Nana? Isn\\'t that what the pimp has been doing?  The pimp and the director are the same.Nana sees Joan of Arc judged by men, and she ostensibly relates.  As the Poe story is read, we see the photo of Elizabeth Taylor behind Nana. Godard is encouraging us to judge Nana (or Karina) in comparison to Elizabeth Taylor. She is being killed, just as Joan of Arc was, by this judgement. The director and the pimp are the same.  Godard prostituted Karina, at least he thought so when he wrote this story.  He drained the life from her and into his canvas, the screen, and presented her for our judgement.  Our Nana doesn\\'t realize that whether she had made into films or had fallen into prostitution, the end result would have been the same.  La morte.',\n",
       " \"Not that this film isn't good, it's very good in a ghoulish sort of way. But the miracle is that it got made at all. Was director Robert Aldrich really a director here or more of a referee.In any event Aldrich in directing Whatever Happened To Baby Jane took a pair of screen legends whose well known and public loathing for each other and managed without being killed to fashion a film about a pair of has been performers who live in the same house with their memories, their problems and mutual hatreds.Bette Davis as Baby Jane Hudson was a child vaudeville performer who like so many child stars was a has been when she became a teen. Not to worry about income because when she became a teen, her younger sister Blanche played by Joan Crawford then became the family breadwinner. But that came to an end when she was crippled in a car crash and it was widely believed that her sister had deliberately used the car as a weapon of jealousy.So these two with everything and yet nothing in common are bound to the family house and each other. Crawford a prisoner in her wheelchair and Davis a prisoner of her own fantasies as she retreats gradually into her childhood and glory days.Crawford is seeing how Davis is becoming more and more unhinged and decides to sell the family estate and get Davis into the 1962 equivalent of Happydale. But Davis gets wind of the plan and she makes Crawford a prisoner in her own home and eventually Davis just loses it totally.The wrap up of shooting must have been a day celebrated by Robert Aldrich on each anniversary the rest of his life. But he got himself a film that's as fascinating as a bloody 20 car pile up on the Interstate. Whatever Happened To Baby Jane got an Oscar for costume design for a black and white film and four other nominations.One of those nominations was for Best Actress, a then record 10 of them for Bette Davis in the title role. Bette Davis was an actress who could make some mediocre films entertaining when she took the brakes off. Here the role called for the most outrageous kind of overacting and Bette made the most of it. Joan's more subdued role of the victim in this film, good as she was didn't have a chance next to Bette's for recognition. Of course Crawford legendarily took a perverse pleasure in being the honorary acceptor for Anne Bancroft when she won the Oscar for Best Actress for The Miracle Worker in 1962. Truth be told Anne was the Best Actress that year.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane is such a two woman film that the rest of the cast is just left in the dust. Another miracle occurred when Victor Buono received some recognition with a nomination for Best Supporting Actor as the mother fixated pianist who plays along with Bette Davis when she decides to revive her career. Of course the strange noises and doings in that house eventually creep him out. Buono's scenes are all with Davis and with the scene stealing Marjorie Bennett who's kind of a mirror image of Baby Jane Hudson as Buono's inebriated mother. Just holding his own with these two I'm figuring the Academy figured Buono deserved some recognition.Bette and Joan, both were destined to be trapped in mediocrity for the most part in roles well beneath their talents. Bette to her credit did escape with such things as an Agatha Christie mystery occasionally and The Whales Of August. But mostly she and Joan did horror flicks because of the impression that Whatever Happened To Baby Jane left on the minds of the movie-going public. Both also got unceremoniously dissed by their daughters in memoirs, Bette not having the decency to die before B.D. Hyman's book came out.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane as repulsively fascinating as it is is a testament to two screen legends and the stamina of director Robert Aldrich who got them to share the screen.\",\n",
       " '\\\\\"What Ever Happened To Baby Jane\\\\\" is a tense horror film, yet it seems almost comical at the same time. The story is about Baby Jane Hudson, a former child Vaudeville star who has now grown older and been shyed away from the spotlight and attention that she so dearly loved. Baby Jane has a sister, Blanche, who is now crippled and restrained to a wheelchair. But before becoming immobile, Blanche was once a movie queen herself, and she incidentally pushed her sister out of the spotlight, which ignited extreme jealousy from Baby Jane. Now, Baby Jane spends most of her time in a crumbling Hollywood mansion, taking care of her sister. She plays mean and dirty tricks on her, even going as far as to preparing Blanche a dead rat on her lunch platter and brutally beating her when she tries to phone for help, keeping Blanche contained within the walls of their home. Baby Jane lives in a world of false hope, thinking that she may be able to reprise her childhood career, putting on makeup and keeping her curly hair intact. But Baby Jane\\'s continued jealousy burns on as Blanche\\'s popular films are re-run on television, and her violent, twisted, and abusive side begins to come forth.The entire film surrounds the two sisters as they fight back and forth, doing horrible things to each other. It\\'s like a grown-up case of sibling rivalry between two of Hollywood\\'s leading women, that turns out to be very well crafted and interesting to watch. Both Davis and Crawford, Hollywood legends, give top quality performances and bring depth and dimension to the characters of Baby Jane and Blanche. Granted, there is no shock value in this film anymore because it has become so dated, but it is still worth the while to watch because of how interesting it is to watch both actresses interact with one another. Davis plays the mad Jane with perfect mannerisms and eerie hysterical expressions as she torments her sister, costumed in ghostly white, caked makeup and golden curls in her hair.It is kind of ironic because it has been speculated that Davis and Crawford really despised each other behind camera, they were both major award winners with legendary status in cinema, practically rivals themselves, which could have played into the way they treated each other in the film... or maybe not? I\\'d say it was very likely though. To sum it up this review, \\\\\"What Ever Happened To Baby Jane\\\\\" is a dated but exceptionally-crafted thriller. Modern day audiences will not be frightened, but the film itself was very, very well done. 9/10.',\n",
       " \"I saw this film for the first time on TCM this week. It was really thought provoking. What fascinated me was that there were people in the room who had all sorts of skills to figure out the problem and become free, but did not. Another intriguing aspect was that nothing: marriage, love, death, children, jobs, or intelligence and logic was enough to solve the problem. The solution comes in a very interesting way and the least likely person. I hope you will watch and check it out. There was also a strong parallel between the catholic church and the people trapped in the room. I wondered if they were illustrating the socialist belief that 'religion is the opiate of the people.' The sheep were not eaten by the bear and all of these symbols were politically interesting. I have never written a review before and I hope I have not included any spoiler but this is a movie I would love to discuss over coffee: it is intelligent, mesmerizing, and a lesson for our time.\",\n",
       " '(excuse me for my bad English)Thoughts on Fellini\\'s carrier can be divided on people who think his peak was early neorealist phase (Vitelloni, La Strada, Nights of Cabiria) (do you remember the guy in the line from Woody Allen\\'s Annie Hall?) and on the ones that praised his fantasy phase starting with La Dolce Vita and followed by 8 1/2, Roma etc.They are both wrong. Both periods and its films are very important, cinematically rich and skillful in directing. The fact that there are many followers of both periods and equal artistic success shows that the only real difference is among their aesthetics. And isn\\'t that what makes a great director?This film is considered one of the best movies of all time among critics and directors. Many people have complaints of how this movie is difficult to understand. It is. When I first saw it, it was a rather very frustrating experience. But once you capture it fully its amazing. In fact, I fully captured it after the third viewing (and after that, every time I see it I can find something new or different). That\\'s because this movie works differently. It works out of standard movie patterns and conventions we use to see in everyday cinema. Above, and most important of all, it speaks with the different movie language. And that is a real cinematic language, because 8 1/2 uses specific movie instruments to transmit it\\'s content. It cannot be transferred in any other form, including literal. That\\'s why it is so hard to put the plot into the words and that\\'s the major merit of this film.After the tremendous commercial and artistic success in 1960. with his previous film La Dolce Vita, Fellini decided to make a film (8 1/2) about the movie director (played by Marcello Mastroianni as Guido) fresh from recent success who is not sure what to film next! And this egocentric director, under the pressure of his producer, actors, friends, fans and journalists, is escaping into the memories of his childhood, wishful fantasies and dreams. At the beginning of the film, there\\'s a stunning famous dream sequence. Guido is trapped in a traffic jam. He loses his breath while unsuccessfully trying to escape from his car. People around (in their vehicles) are starring at him. The whole scene is mute (except the constant monotonous sound) and, from time to time, it freezes. Suddenly, he is free, and flying towards sky. Then, one of his assistants pulls him down to earth. And, he is awake. I think it\\'s unnecessary to explain the meaning of this brilliant scene.There is also a scene where he is persuaded to ask a catholic priest for an advice about the content of his next film (since his films are widely released there is a moral issue). But he apparently has an aversion towards Church. And then, during a conversation with this priest, Guido suddenly associates his early childhood event (watching a dance of a prostitute Saraghina, and the subsequent punishment by one priest). So, the current event forces its cause to come out of his subconsciousness.Then, there is a scene \\\\u0096 quarrel between Guido and his wife (played by Anuk Aimee) while sitting outdoors. She is complaining about his mistress(es) and he is denying everything. Then, his mistress (Sandra Milo) suddenly arrives and, after she saw Guido with his wife, sits to one table not so close. Guido\\'s wife noticed that and realized that woman is his mistress. So, she is continuing her quarrel with him. And then comes one of the most visceral and fascinating scenes in the Movie History. Suddenly, wishful fantasy starts\\\\u0085 Guido\\'s wife stands up, coming towards mistress. They are kissing each other like longtime friends and making a nice conversation. Then, Guido enters his house from the childhood (which is shown before) with some presents in his hands. And, there are like 20 women around him fighting for his attention. He is whipping them (dominate them). And there is his wife \\\\u0096 peaceful, calm, conservative, loving\\\\u0085 So, under the pressure of all-around-him messes he is fantasying. This is psychologically known as the regression to the pleasure principle and is very common. This scene is known as \\\\\"The Harem Scene\\\\\" and like others is followed by brilliant, very suitable music score.From time to time, Guido is fantasying a beautiful young woman (Claudia Cardinale). She is another projection of his narcissism \\\\u0096 an ideal woman to please all of his wishes not making a single complaint.Rosella represents (symbolizes) his super-ego. Pay attention to their phone conversation. Also in Harem scene (harem is actually his Id, fulfilling all his infantile fantasies) she is ABOVE him making complaints.His producer is \\\\\"paternal figure\\\\\". All his father\\'s wishes, demands to Guido are now \\\\\"reactivated\\\\\" with producer. Pay attention to very interesting first \\\\\"fantasy\\\\\" scene in the movie (on the grave). Father asks a man something like:\\\\\" How is my boy doing\\\\\"? and the man makes face like: \\\\\"Well...\\\\\". Later we discover that the man is his producer.Guido\\'s wife and his mother, the same thing.

The overwrought and over-the-top acting ends up being annoying instead of amusing.

       " 'I had longed to see this film for years, having only seen b/w stills and brief clips. Finally, Glasgow Film Theatre got a new print in their Visconti retrospective in 2003, and it was certainly worth the wait!\\'Il Gattopardo\\' is a marvellous film, a magnificently realised slice of 19C history presented through the lives of engaging but humanly fallible characters. Don Fabrizio, Prince of Salina, is a shrewd, benevolent man of 45, trying to navigate a passage for his family through the social and political turmoil of the Risorgimento in Sicily. (I was stunned that some reviewers thought there was too much discussion of politics in the film - it is essential to the story and its context!) Burt Lancaster gives surely his greatest performance as Don Fabrizio, coming to terms with the fact that he is among the last of a dying breed: born too late to dwell in an unchanging aristocratic world, but too early to adapt fully to the modern world, unlike his nephew Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon). As he tells the royal envoy from the mainland: \\\\\"We are the leopards, the lions; after us will come the jackals and hyenas\\\\\".Tancredi embodies the best and worst of the rising generation: he is dashing and full of vitality, but he breaks the heart of his shy, sensitive cousin Concetta (Lucilla Morlacchi), and is just as fickle in his political loyalties - although this ensures he will survive in the new Italy. His engagement to Angelica Sedara (Claudia Cardinale), daughter of the nouveau-riche mayor, secures the family\\'s future. Angelica is a fine example of how well the characters are drawn: no idealised romantic heroine, but a vital, beautiful girl with a vulgar streak. She laughs interminably and loudly at Tancredi\\'s coarse jokes at the table - not how a 19C young lady was expected to behave: you sense the cringes this induces in the rest of the family, despite the fact she is \\'a good catch\\' in material terms, and is basically good.The other supporting characters are worth attention, delineated with affectionate humour: Angelica\\'s social-climbing father; Princess Maria Stella (Rina Morelli), with her glum piety and fits of the vapours (one can easily believe her husband\\'s quip, \\\\\"We have seven children, but I\\'ve never even seen her navel!\\\\\"); the family chaplain, Father Pirrone (Romolo Valli), with whom Don Fabrizio has amusing bouts of verbal sparring.But it is as much the look of this film, besides the intelligent script and excellent characterisations, which makes it so special. The costumes are among the best I have ever seen in a 19C-set film. The landscape and architecture of Sicily are shown to tremendous effect: you can feel the heat, the dust. Dust? Yes - and that is one of the best things about the film: its physical realism. When the characters go on long carriage journeys, they get visibly dusty; their palaces have shabby, disused rooms and semi-derelict wings, as well as majolica floors; the all-night ball - a tour-de-force of colour and spectacle - results in a retiring-room full of used chamber-pots; the rural villages are as dilapidated as picturesque. Too many costume dramas present perpetually well-groomed characters in immaculate environments, no dirt or untidiness: \\'Il Gattopardo\\' does not.The film ends with Don Fabrizio walking home after the ball, having come to terms with his mortality and seen the younger generation preparing to take centre stage. If you want to meet him again in his final years, and see what becomes of Concetta and Angelica as the 20C dawns, then read Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\\'s original novel, of which this exquisite film is a faithful and sensitive adaptation.And to see the characters now? About the same time I first saw this film, I got a picture-book of the mummies of Palermo: fragile parchment-skin and bone in fraying 18-19C finery. The same sense of the transience of beauty, of change and mortality, pervades the mummies and the film alike: one auburn-haired youth even resembles Francesco Paolo, the Salinas\\' young son. \\\\\"Dust and ashes!\\\\\" writes Browning; \\\\\"Mais o\\\\u00f9 sont les neiges d\\'antan?\\\\\" says Villon. But thanks to Visconti\\'s masterpiece, we can still see \\'the snows of last year\\' at the point of their dissolution.',\n",
       " \"Burt Lancaster plays a true aristocrat in an aristocracy that is not an aristocracy. The degeneracy as well as the sophistication of the rival political factions in warring Sicily is shown, and the human insight of the central character that embodies true nobility, even though he is largely powerless to make his ideals reality. Garibaldi is invading Sicily with an army of a thousand, landing in Marsala and advancing through Palermo. Prince Salina (Lancaster) is a noble of a disappearing age. He refuses a place in the new senate and is unable to convince the new wave that the unification will not be good for Sicily. He is caught between different loyalties. A love story between his nephew (played by Alain Delon) and a rich merchant's daughter (played by Claudia Cardinale) interweaves the action and heightens the moral dilemmas that Prince Salina has to face. A brave film, opposing, exposing and opposed by government and church. The full length restored edition is a cinematic gem and the opulent costumes and scenery are a treasure to behold.\",\n",
       " 'I was rounding off a two year study in France in 1963 and I remember gazing at the marquee of a cinema in Paris shortly after the Cannes Festival, seeing \\\\\"Le Guepard\\\\\" advertised, beautiful Claudia Cardinale waltzing with handsome, courtly, Burt Lancaster. At the time, I made a mental note to see the movie but in fact, saw it for the first time many years later, on a black and white TV no less! Chopped up and edited as it was, in black and white, the film moved me immensely. I was absolutely thunderstruck by the dialogue which, when I read the Prince of Lampedusa\\'s novel shortly after, I realized had been \\\\\"lifted\\\\\" verbatim from the novel in large chunks. What a novel and what a worthy and noble tribute to it Visconti has paid. I now own the Criterion three disk set of Il Gattopardo and never tire of watching what is for me, one of the great films of the twentieth century. Burt Lancaster, as the Prince of Salina, was an inspired choice for the cinematic role, though apparently he was not Luchino Visconti\\'s choice. I think the Prince of Salina is Lancaster\\'s finest performance.',\n",

This movie does not need the glitz of Hollywood effects because there is enough cranial content to more than compensate for what most people nowadays consider necessary visual enhancements. The cast has an amazing chemistry and plausibility. I don't recommend this movie to effects-addicts.

It falls to the President (ably played by Henry Fonda) to make the agonizing decision of how to handle the situation without causing a global thermonuclear war.From the Soviet point of view, here\\'s what happens.  The hot line in Moscow rings.  The premier picks it up to hear the American president explaining that three unstoppable bombers are on their way to obliterate Moscow.  Oh, but it was an accident.

And we can\\'t call them back, because they\\'re beyond their fail safe position (and thus are trained to maintain complete radio silence and ignore any communication they may receive), and we can\\'t shoot them down because they\\'re way out of our range.  Sorry.  Our bad.The pacing of the movie moves from a calm, cool tone while various media figures are shown around the facility in charge of all the bombers.  Then it picks up a tiny bit as the facility detects a bogie over Hudson Bay.  And this is where the situation begins that eventually leads to the erroneous deployment of a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union.  Although it seems small at the time, this is the metaphorical horseshoe nail that loses the kingdom.  (\\\\\"For want of a nail....\\\\\")  From this point, the movie steadily increases the suspence as progressively more drastic measures are taken in the effort to stop these bombers, with the situation growing more desperate by the moment.  I started out firmly positioned on my seat, but by the end I had moved further and further forward towards the edge of my seat until eventually I couldn\\'t even sit still.  Too much suspense.There are quite a lot of technical errors in the film (for instance, due to the Air Force refusing to assist in the film, they had to resort to a fairly limited set of stock footage for the shots of aircraft, which are thus extremely inaccurate) but it remains a good movie.  If you can ignore the errors in set design and stock footage and concentrate instead on the dialog (which is where the action is anyway), watching people rise to the challenge or snap under the pressure, this is a movie you will never, ever forget.',\n",

       " '\\\\\"Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte\\\\\" was, as most people know, intended as a follow up (not a sequel) to the first and most influential \\\\\"horror hag\\\\\" film of them all, \\\\\"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?\\\\\". Producer/director Robert Aldrich who had helmed \\\\\"Jane\\\\\" wanted to repeat that film\\'s box office success. He re-teamed Bette Davis (as Charlotte) and Joan Crawford (as her cousin Miriam) but, in events that have become the stuff of Hollywood Legend, Crawford became \\\\\"ill\\\\\" and checked into the hospital and wouldn\\'t come out. She was eventually replaced by Bette\\'s long-standing friend, Olivia de Havilland, fresh from \\\\\"Lady in a Cage\\\\\" (1964). Although many find the plot somewhat convoluted, it is basically rather simple. Aging southern belle Charlotte Hollis lives in decayed splendor in the Louisiana mansion where, thirty seven years earlier, a horrible murder took place. The victim was none other than her married lover John Mayhew (Bruce Dern, in an early screen appearance) whom Charlotte fears was killed by her overbearing father (Victor Buono) who was against their affair. Over the years, however, the local townspeople have concluded that Charlotte herself was responsible, but escaped punishment due to her father\\'s political connections. As it happens, the highway commission is planning on building a bridge where Charlotte\\'s house stands, and are tirelessly trying to remove her from the property. She is just as doggedly determined to remain, because she fears demolition of the house will reveal proof of her father\\'s guilt. Charlotte\\'s only companions are her old, white trash housekeeper, Velma Crother (Agnes Moorehead) and the family doctor, Drew Bayliss (Joseph Cotten). Charlotte\\'s attempts to hold off the sheriff are finally beginning to weaken, so, in a last attempt to hold onto the old plantation, she sends for her Cousin Miriam Deering, hoping she can help. Miriam does, eventually arrive, but it\\'s soon obvious that she is there for reasons other than to comfort and aid her cousin.The film is well photographed in eminently suitable black and white, and the haunting musical score by an Oscar-nominated Frank DeVol (as well as the beautiful nominated title song) aid it immeasurably. The performances are what makes the movie so much fun. Bette Davis, as usual, goes all out as the tormented cousin, moaning, whining simpering and,especially shrieking her way through her part. In contrast, the still very attractive de Havilland is, at first, a model of restraint. Matching Davis in the histrionics department is Moorehead (who was also Oscar-nominated for her performance) as she carries on, sometimes so hilariously, it\\'s difficult to understand what she is saying. (Oh well, that\\'s what DVD subtitles are for!) At the same time, she can be moving as well. Cotten gets to do his own (relatively restrained) scenery-chewing , but the scenes in which Davis, de Havilland and Moorehead scream at each other in very thick southern accents could be right out of the old \\\\\"Mama\\'s Family\\\\\" TV series. As Jewel Mayhew, widow of Bette\\'s lover, Mary Astor gives her usual excellent performance, so subdued and realistic, that she seems to be in a different film. Ditto Cecil Kellaway as a curious insurance investigator. In the end, though, it\\'s all the overplaying and gaudy scene stealing which makes \\\\\"Charlotte\\\\\" so much fun. A remake would be not only redundant, but a mistake. \\\\\"Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte\\\\\" is truly one of a kind. The just-released Fox DVD includes a great widescreen transfer of the film, an audio commentary, and, best of all, a trailer, teaser trailer and three television spots, which emphasize the movie\\'s lurid aspects--what else could you want? GET IT NOW!',\n",

Following two years after \\\\\"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\\\\\", \\\\\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\\\\" is nevertheless four times the film of its more noted predecessor.  The reasons for this are four=fold.  The script, though occasionally unintentionally funny, is still crisper, more believable and contains a more satisfying ending.  Next, Davis\\' is more balanced by the performances of DeHavilland, Cotton, a more mature Victor Buono, and the great Agnes Morehead. Thirdly, we have a better set and setting, more attuned to the genre.  Finally, the cinematography is several notches better, in my opinion.  Adding it all up, you have an exceptionally fine example of that unique genre, the gothic melodrama.  In this movie, the genre is virtually defined!  If asked to name an example to a \\\\\"top twenty\\\\\" or \\\\\"top fifty\\\\\" movie list, \\\\\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\\\\" would definitely make the cut.',\n",

If you think about it, Last Tango In Paris could have been a Hitchcock movie. An American in Paris meets a young girl, they have sex without knowing anything about each other and ends up in murder. Marnie is truly perverse and Sean Connery's obsession for Tippi Hedren is infinitely more perverse than whatever poor Tippi Hedren suffers from. He is turned on by her rejection. The kiss during the gelid honeymoon stays inches away from necrophilia. right?. The script is just delicious. Sean Connery goes for the troublesome center of his character, yes he does, whether consciously or unconsciously. Tippi Hedren is terrific here and with all the things we know now about the making of the movie her performance has acquired some extra something.

       " 'A glorious film just a few things to add to what everyone else has said[NB SPOILERS towards the bottom of the page - not that the plot is exactly a suspense]It\\'s a \\\\\"realistic\\\\\" story on the face of it. The whole thing is reminiscent of the \\\\\"verismo\\\\\" Italian operas from the end of the 19th century, like Cavalleria Rusticana, where soap-opera plots about ordinary people are set to emotionally stunning over-the-top drama-queen music - inherently a democratic kind of style, saying that shopworkers and little old ladies have as much right to passion and glory as kings or gangsters or movie stars.Yes, the singing is silly. But the film knows this - in the very first scene the men in the washroom joke about \\\\\"Carmen\\\\\" (another example of the same style) and one of them sings something like \\\\\"I\\'m going to see a film, I don\\'t like Opera, I can\\'t stand all the singing\\\\\". Its a film that *knows* mechanics don\\'t (usually) sing arias while they check the oil, and makes a joke about it. Buffy fans will have got the same point from \\\\\"Once more with feeling\\\\\" - the Fundamental Problem of the Musical is: \\\\\"why is everybody singing?\\\\\"But there is something unrealistic about it, the beauty. Everyone and everything is good-looking. The people are beautiful. The dirty old town is beautiful. Cheap bars are beautiful. Squalid damp flats are beautiful. Abandoned hulk ships are beautiful. A garage forecourt with petrol pumps and a canopy is beautiful. All the men are good-looking. And as for the women - someone asked why more men than women like this weepy film. The obvious answer is Catherine Deneuve. But Anne Vernon playing her mother is cuter than anyone her age has a right to be. And as for Ellen Farner... Guy has not one but two stupendously attractive women after him, which is about 1.99 more than the average member of the audience.The costumes match the background far too often for it to be anything but deliberate. At first its even more confusing than the singing. Madame Emery dresses differently to match the wallpaper of the shop and her flat, sometimes her clothes even seem to change colour for no reason other than to match the scenery. Genevieve stands in front of a window while a truck that\\'s exactly the same shade as her cardigan pulls up behind her. When she tries on her maternity dress it has the same combination of royal blue background and pink flowers as the wallpaper behind her. When she walks past the docks with Roland they are both wearing different shades of off-white - hers matches the rusting paint on the old ships, his matches the cliffs visible in the distance. When Guy and Madeleine sit next to each other outside the cafe her orange-brown clothes and even her lipstick match the door behind her while his dark brown jacket matches not only the wood behind him but also her hair - exactly the same trick we\\'ve seen when he was sitting next to the prostitute Jenny with her red dress on front of the red screen inside the other bar. We are in fantasy land here, even if it looks a little like Cherbourg. but this is all the same as the singing. To ask \\\\\"how does a poor family afford such clothes?\\\\\" or \\\\\"why is the delivery van exactly that shade of yellow?\\\\\" is to miss the point as much as to ask \\\\\"why does a shopkeeper sing to his customers?\\\\\" or \\\\\"why does it always rain when we say goodbye?\\\\\". In this movie, in this fantasy land, the world is turned upside down, the meek can inherit the earth (or at least look as if they might), small-town Cherbourg is as romantic as Paris, sailors and truck-drivers sing while they work, the poor wear clothes that money can\\'t buy, the scenery changes colour to match your wardrobe, every man looks like a leading man, and every shop-girl truly is as beautiful as any duchess. This is \\\\\"Singing in the Rain\\\\\" set in the backroom of a shop instead of the back lot of a Hollywood studio, this is \\\\\"West Side Story\\\\\" without the violence, this is a small-town \\\\\"Moulin Rouge\\\\\", this is \\\\\"Brief Encounter\\\\\" on acid.It\\'s not a tragic ending, any more than the endings of Casablanca or Brief Encounter are tragic. It\\'s the right ending. We\\'re not so much sad for Genevieve - even though we are crying - as we are happy for Roland (who deserves a break. Even though we know he\\'s probably a crook) If we are crying its because Guy needs to hug Francoise. We expect that the marriages will work out in the end - maybe they have worked out already. If these people are not going to be happy its not because they married the wrong partners. and what other film has had hundreds of thousands of viewers in floods of tears watching an aerial shot of an Esso service station?',\n",
       " 'Maybe not. Les Parapluies de Cherbourg is one of the most beautiful movies ever made with an enchanting and haunting score by Michel Le Grande, and totally focused, sharp and creative direction by Jacques Demy. Catherine Deneuve gives a fine performance in pinkish white makeup with her blonde hair pulled away from her famous face, at twenty playing a seventeen-year-old shopkeeper\\'s daughter who falls in love with a garage mechanic. He is called away to the war in Algeria after making her pregnant. Will she wait for him as the award-winning song proclaims? Will their love endure the long separation?All the dialogue is sung. The script is terse with nothing extraneous to the bittersweet story. Because the dialogue is stripped to the barest essentials, the singing seems natural and enhances the dream-like quality established early with the rain falling on the umbrellas and the cobblestone streets of the seacoast town. The sets are splashed in vivid color. Everything is superficially romantic, but the events are the starkest realism.When a young girl if forced to choose between love and security, which does she choose? It depends on the circumstances, and sometimes circumstances and the passage of time can change her heart.I was a teenager in France when this was made in the sixties. The backdrops of the white Esso gas station, the red and yellow passenger train cars, the bouffant hair styles on the girls, their eyes heavily made up with mascara and black eyeliner, the ubiquitous bicycles and the little French \\\\\"cigarette roller\\\\\" cars all brought back vivid memories of youth as did the musical score. A question: what ever happened to the \\\\\"other\\\\\" girl, Ellen Farner who played Madeleine? To be honest I found her more attractive than Deneuve who of course went on to become a great star and an acclaimed international beauty.Farner was never heard from again.Some scenes made more effective by their simplicity: When Genevi\\\\u00e8re (Deneuve) returns home after a late evening with Guy, her mother (Anne Vernon) surveys her daughter and exclaims, \\\\\"What have you done?\\\\\" Genevi\\\\u00e8re retorts sharply, \\\\\"Mama!\\\\\" and it is clear what she has done. Also, as Guy is going off to the army Madeleine arrives upon the scene as he is saying good-bye to his stepmother who is ill. They exchange glances that reveal Madeleine\\'s love for him. And then she sings out softly in the heartfelt regret of parting, \\\\\"Adieu, Guy.\\\\\" We know these are not the last words that will pass between them. Additionally, the brief, beautifully structured, final scene at the shiny new Esso gas station is not to be forgotten.The scenes with Roland Cassard (Marc Michel), the suave, traveling man of means who sells Madame Emery\\'s jewelry so she can pay the taxes on her umbrella shop, are nicely staged so that we can see at a glance that he is enormously taken with Genevi\\\\u00e8re and that the mother will do everything possible to further his case. It is agreeable for those identifying with Genevi\\\\u00e8re that Roland is not only well off financially, but is as handsome as the garage mechanic. But will he still want her when he learns that she is pregnant with another man\\'s child?Jacques Demy who also wrote the script is to be commended for the effortless pace and tight focus of this romantic tale of star crossed lovers. I wish every director had such an ability to cut the extraneous and concentrate on the essentials without intrusion. The tale is an atmospheric tour de force of love lost and gained, of bourgeois values triumphant.This might be a bit precious for some, but upon seeing this for the third time, I can tell you I was enchanted anew.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \\\\\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\\\\" Get it at Amazon!)',\n",

What is surprising to me today is not that a Japanese filmmaker almost unknown in the US was nominated, but that the Motion Picture Academy in 1966 had such a keen aesthetic sense as to appreciate his radical work. \\\\\"Woman in the Dunes\\\\\" (Suna no onna) was far ahead of its time, radiating Absolute Beauty.An entomologist (Eiji Okada) seeks lodging for the night in the dunes, and is led by the villagers to the bottom of a sandpit where he finds a widow (Kyoko Kishida) living in a shack. Next morning he discovers he can no longer climb out. He is expected to remain there and to live with the woman, who needs a man\\'s help. Because the sand drifts into the shack without cease, shoveling sand away from the sandpit is her primary daily routine. After all attempts to escape the situation fail, he becomes accustomed to it and finds another way of life.It is almost meaningless to try to ascertain any scientific or economic logic beneath the surface of this allegorical story (written by Kobo Abe). Such hairsplitting will only make you lose the merit of this work. The primary subject of the story seems to lie in a certain passive mentality to be called \\\\\"mental inertia,\\\\\" mental acclimation, conformity, or something like that. \\\\\"Mental inertia\\\\\" is caused by \\\\\"usualness\\\\\" (or \\\\\"dailiness\\\\\"), and comes to dominate the subconscious in due course. Abe and Teshigahara metaphorically depict such \\\\\"usualness\\\\\" as the character of sand -- usualness formed in an unusual situation.The woman has a strong mental attachment to the status quo around her; despite the cruel fact that the sand has killed her husband and daughter, she prefers to stay there and not to change her life. This is the \\\\\"mental inertia\\\\\" of the work. The entomologist, too. He at first thinks the whole situation surrounding the woman absurd, and tries to escape it. However, he becomes accustomed to the situation day by day, and accepts such absurdity after all. By whom is he forced to do so? The villagers? No. Himself! He chooses to return to the sandpit and stay there even when he becomes free to leave. He becomes a captive in the dunes by \\\\\"mental inertia\\\\\" just as he has been in the city.After seeing this work, I came to feel that many variants of \\\\\"invisible sand,\\\\\" which might dominate our \\\\\"free will,\\\\\" are drifting and accumulating around us without cease, whether or not we realize it.Pictures are great. The sand is living here, showing various expressions. Surely it \\\\\"acts\\\\\" as a main character in several impressive scenes, including an unforgettable love scene where the couple is caked with it.And, music! -- if we may call this incomparable sound work so. It not only enhances each scene fully, but also gives life to things that are not expressed in image alone. From barbaric drum music through sensual sound like the sand\\'s \\\\\"breathing,\\\\\" Takemistu-sound is full of imagination and magic.A perfect fusion of Image, Sound, and Subject. See \\\\\"Woman in the Dunes\\\\\" and die.',\n",
       " \"One of the most entertaining heist films of all time. Full of original ideas, smartly written and joyfully directed. And, if all that wasn't enough, Peter Ustinov! He won his second Oscar as best supporting actor for this creation - an unsuccessful small time crook, intelligent enough to know that he's not intelligent enough - without country and without future. Ustinov soars. He is surrounded by a group of Euro-heavy weights, Melina Mercouri, Maximilian Schell, Robert Morley, Akim Tammiroff. The suspense, fun filled entrance to the Topkapi museum was stolen and disguised with a multi dollar budget by Brian De Palma and his accomplices in the first Mission Impossible without being able to duplicate the suspense, the fun, the humanity or the innocence of the proceedings. The locations are another treat, the music, the costumes and the honesty with which the dishonesty of the characters is portrayed. A true delight.\",\n",
       " 'When I was a little kid, I watched \\\\\"Battle of the Bulge\\\\\" approximately 58 million times. I thought it was the cat\\'s pajamas.But even back then, my young and usually trusting mind could detect a strong whiff of baloney from this movie. I had difficultly believing, for example, that every Allied soldier in World War II was an incompetent nitwit except for the all-knowing, all-seeing Henry Fonda. Throughout the course of this movie, Fonda\\'s character predicts the battle (rather like a psychic, or someone with access to the script), uncovers every weakness in the German plan, and then finally plays a key role in stopping the entire German offensive. What a versatile guy, huh? And yes, even my inexperienced child-self found it rather weird that, in this movie, the Americans are depicted as being utterly incapable of fighting the Germans. The film suggests, in a somewhat insulting fashion, that in point of fact the Americans did not win this battle in the traditional way - we only won it because the Germans ran out of gasoline and decided to walk home! What complete rubbish. Anybody with even a vague understanding of the real battle knows that the Americans won simply by counterattacking - what a novel idea! Some commentators on this site have argued that the film\\'s historical inaccuracies don\\'t matter, and that only World War II nerds will be offended by the script\\'s tinkering with history. However, I would argue that \\\\\"Battle of the Bulge\\\\\" is SO inaccurate that such a defense doesn\\'t hold water. And it\\'s not as though the inaccuracies make the film better; in fact, I\\'m confident that a more realistic portrayal of the battle would have made the film far more exciting, even-handed, and worthwhile.And yet... and yet... I still like this stupid movie! The tank battles are fun, the music is great, and the cast is really top-notch. Here\\'s a general rule of thumb that I apply to the film as a whole - the scenes with the Americans are stupid, and the scenes with the Germans are good. For example - Robert Shaw is simply awesome as the (fictional) German commander. He has a fascinating series of moral debates on the nature of the war with his aide, a long-suffering corporal played by Hans Christian Blech; these scenes are a real highlight of the film, and their intelligence makes for a stark contrast with the general idiocy of other scenes.There\\'s also a very good scene when Charles Bronson tells Fonda that his men are so angry because of the war that they want to completely annihilate Germany and its people. This somewhat sinister note always gets my attention, but it pretty much amounts to nothing.Perhaps the best thing that I can say about this movie is that it got me curious about the real battle, and the war in general. Because it\\'s reasonably cool and exciting, the film is a pretty good vehicle for generating interest in the events it depicts so carelessly. Also, the script is perhaps not quite so inaccurate as some people claim - the early forest battles are somewhat like the real thing, and the general nature and goals of the German offensive are accurately portrayed.It\\'s just that too many dumb Hollywood moments spoil the movie for any serious aficionado of history and/or cinema. That\\'s a shame, really. I wouldn\\'t mind seeing a more accurate remake, which presumably would not involve an omnipotent Henry Fonda singlehandedly foiling the last great German offensive of World War II.',\n",
       " 'I ask myself why we never see these kind of movies on TV, instead of airing again and again the same old lethal weapons, jurassic parks, and other similar stuff? This is real cinema, this is why it is considered a form of art!With the metaphysical crudeness of black and white, the dramatical facts of the Algerian rebellion against the French are accounted. The movie has the realistic appearance of a chronicle. And there are tons of intellectual honesty, too. I mean that there are no white hats VS black hats. You can see terrorists troubled as they are about to leave a bomb in a cafe. Policemen who struggle to save an arabian child from being killed by outraged crowd.

       " \"Carol Lynley does some fabulous work here as American woman newly arrived in England whose little daughter is apparently kidnapped from school on her first day. The catch is, nobody knows the child and Lynley is having trouble proving she even exists! Terrific mystery from director Otto Preminger, an uneven filmmaker who does strong work just up to the finale (which is somewhat anti-climactic). Laurence Olivier is the police inspector on the case and he's very smooth, cunning and yet sympathetic to Lynley. There are some mod overtures which seem misplaced, and No\\\\u00ebl Coward has a gratuitous bit as Carol's drunken landlord (and BBC celebrity!), yet the film does have many sharp bits of minute detail, intriguing and funny supporting characters, terrific cinematography and locations. Does it all add up? No, but it's inscrutable fun nevertheless. *** from ****\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful, timeless epic romances of all time, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Stunning cinematography combines here with a turbulent historical setting, an unforgettable idealistic hero, and one of the most compelling fictional love triangles of all time. This surely ranks among the best of director David Lean's many masterpieces. It is based on Boris Pasternak's novel, which I confess to not having read so cannot comment on the faithfulness of the film.The story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet, Yuri Zhivago, and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the Russian Revolution. The story is told in flashback mode during later Communist years by Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, a Soviet Army officer, to the young woman, Tanya, who may be the long lost daughter of Yuri and his lover, Lara. As a sensitive young boy, Yuri's mother dies and he is adopted by a foster family, the Gromekos. Later reaching adulthood, he studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart, Tonya, and they have a little boy, Sasha. However, earlier at their engagement party, he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful &amp; mysterious woman named Lara. Soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution.The handsome Omar Sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of Zhivago, masterfully conveying his character's emotions. Who can forget his intensely expressive, tear filled eyes at some of the more emotional moments, especially with snowflakes melting on them? A physician but also a poet, Yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty around him. His gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the horrific violence of war and revolution, as Yuri witnesses such atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism. Also, this is a man who remains very much an individual despite the Bolshevik's philosophies of collectivism.That era's devastating events unfold, including the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Civil War between the Tsarist Whites &amp; the Communist Reds. However, the main conflict here is internal within Yuri's own heart, as he is torn between fidelity and passion. He deeply loves his sweet, gentle, and dependable wife, Tonya, and struggles to remain faithful. Yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the alluring Lara, a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are caring for wounded soldiers. Lara serves as his muse, speaks to his soul, and is the inspiration for his poetry. Unlike most modern cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt, Yuri and Lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are repeatedly brought together (and separated) by the upheaval of war and revolution. Surely if Yuri is 'the worst of sinners, then he is the worst of sufferers also'.The two women in Yuri's life, wife and mistress, stand in sharp contrast, though both come across as sympathetic characters. The lovely Geraldine Chaplain portrays his ladylike, aristocratic wife, Tonya, who is well bred and has been schooled abroad. The daughter of the bourgeois Gromeko, she is actually Yuri's step sister, which might understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings from her husband. Yuri and Lara succumb to their passions even as the blameless Tonya is pregnant with Yuri's second child. Tonya is a warm, loving wife and devoted mother, undeserving of her husband's infidelity.Julie Christie plays the gorgeous &amp; enigmatic Lara, a woman whose station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men, yet she possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength. As a teenage girl, she is seduced and violated by the lecherous Victor Komarovsky, a despicable politician and her own mother's lover. She falls under repeated abuse by this vile &amp; contemptible character, who calls Lara a slut and treats her as such. Later she is fianc\\\\u00e9 &amp; then wife to the misguided idealist and activist, Pasha, who holds intense political ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him. Pasha later becomes Strelnikov, the obsessive Bolshevik officer who eventually comes into confrontation with Zhivago. During much of the tumult, Lara entrusts her own &amp; Pasha's daughter, Katya, into the care of others. Of course the legend of Lara lives on musically in Maurice Jarre's lovely, haunting Lara's Theme.Supporting cast members include Rod Steiger, who is perfect as the villainous Komarovsky, and Tom Courtenay as Pasha / Strelnikov, a shy and pure individual who earns the abused Lara's respect and love, later going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary. Alec Guiness portrays Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, and Ralph Richardson is Tonya's aristocratic &amp; gentlemanly father, Alexander Gromeko.This film has amazing Oscar winning cinematography throughout. During World War I and the Revolution, there are vivid scenes of battle, mass desertion, and endless march through the desolate, blizzard ridden Siberian wasteland. Also visually stunning is the spectacular train ride Yuri and his family must make from Moscow to the Urals, site of the family dachau. However, surely most viewers' truly unforgettable pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle at Varykino. No other film can compare in its depiction of winter scenery. This sweeping panorama, the era's tumultuous political events, and the emotional portrait of one sensitive man's experience of them, create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga.\",\n",
       " 'I have been watching this movie since it came out in 1965. It is one of the movies that sent me off to the US Navy in 1967. I recently purchased a DVD copy on the net for a great price and I watched it again. Yes, it is all fiction; but still a great movie against the back drop of WWII and the US Navy in the Pacific. It has battleships, cruisers, destroyers, PT boats, and submarines. It has confused yet brave men and women. It has old fashion love scenes that \\\\\"fade to black after the first kiss\\\\\". It has a rape scene where you do not see the violence; but, it is so well acted it is still terrifying. In the last 40 years I have read dozens of factual books about the US Navy in the Pacific. I still enjoy this movie very much and recommend it.',\n",
       " 'It took me almost 40 years to finally see \\\\\"A Patch of Blue\\\\\". It was promoted as the kind of trendy, raise your social consciousness movie that I avoid like the plague. The mid-sixties was full of this kind of moralizing political stuff, as the country finally began to wake up to the embarrassing social inequities and the hypocrisy that hung over everything like a cloud of poison gas. The older half of the baby boomer generation was beginning to question the fear and hate of their parents, and Hollywood was beginning to discover that this had exploitation potential. Most of these things were moronic at the time and have not improved with age.Ironically, what led to my finally viewing this film was watching Catherine Deneuve in another film from 1965; Polanski\\'s \\\\\"Repulsion\\\\\". Writing a review of that film I lamented the failure of the Academy to nominate Deneuve for Best Actress and Polanski for Best Director. Whatever was thought then about the films and performances actually nominated, in retrospect they pale in comparison to \\\\\"Repulsion\\\\\". No one even gives a thought anymore to \\\\\"Darling\\\\\" or \\\\\"Ship of Fools\\\\\", \\\\\"Doctor Zhivago\\\\\" is more big that it is good, and Julie Andrews was great in a very weak movie (but decent musical). While \\\\\"A Thousand Clowns\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Collector\\\\\"-with Samantha Eggar, are good cult films, they are easy to dismiss.But when I got to Elizabeth Hartman\\'s nomination for \\\\\"A Patch of Blue\\\\\" I realized that I knew very little about her or the performance, having dismissed it as just a reprise of Patty Duke\\'s performance in \\\\\"The Miracle Worker\\\\\". I became more intrigued when I discovered that Hartman was the actress who blew me away in \\\\\"The Beguiled\\\\\", so I picked up a copy of the 2.35x1 aspect ratio DVD of \\\\\"Patch of Blue\\\\\". I was surprised to find that a film with the name of a color in its title had been shot in black and white. And for anyone thinking about getting this DVD, it was transferred to DVD from one of the cleanest prints (or maybe from the original MGM negative)I have ever seen-the detail and contrasts are as good as they must have been when it was first printed 40 years ago.After seeing \\\\\"Patch of Blue\\\\\" I still made my case for \\\\\"Repulsion\\\\\", but qualified it by saying only Hartman\\'s performance was in the same class as that of Deneuve. Which was quite a concession for me but both performances are truly wonderful.As for \\\\\"Patch of Blue\\\\\", I found it absolutely amazing-close to perfection. There were so many places where Guy Green could have screwed it up and he neatly avoided them all.The director is presented with a real problem when deciding how to film an actor playing a blind person. Tight shots on the eyes are what makes acting for the camera so special. Unfortunately the unfocused eyes of a blind person cannot convey much emotion, in fact anything but a blank stare betrays the blind illusion. So Guy Green had to get a verbal and body language performance out Hartman that compensated for not being able to use tight shots, and Hartman had to work at not just playing a complex character but also at maintaining the illusion that she was blind. All her scenes are excellent but she has three that are especially memorable.The first is at the kitchen table where she casually discusses being raped with Gordon. Her matter-of-fact narration plays perfectly with Poitier\\'s horrified reaction (which of course she can\\'t see).The second is after a stranger has helped her back to the apartment from her terrifying failed attempt to find the park by herself. In a few minutes she ranges from despair so deep it verges on madness, to extreme gratitude toward the boy who brings her a message, to giddy joy at the realization that Gordon cares enough about her to send someone to see what has happened to her. Hartman plays all parts of the scene convincingly-I wonder if they shot it all the same day or if Green shot each sequence separately.The third scene (and my personal favorite) is when she is alone in the park and it starts to rain. If someone told me of the challenges posed by this scene, I would not have given it much chance of success, yet Green pulls it off and Hartman is absolutely believable. The is the scene where you first really connect to Selena\\'s fear and isolation, because by this time you know and identify with the character. Absolutely amazing.Here is a little Elizabeth Hartman trivia. After Patty Duke turned down the role because of type-casting concerns and Hayley Mills for financial reasons (what a disaster that would have been), they tested 150 unknowns and choose the 22 year old Hartman. \\\\\"I believe I was lacking the things they wanted an actress to lack,\\\\\" Hartman told Sidney Skolsky when he made her the subject of one of his \\\\\"Tintypes\\\\\" profiles. After meeting her Slolsky said: \\\\\"She is shy, timid. She sleeps in a normal-size bed in sleeveless nightgowns. She always takes her Raggedy-Ann doll to bed with her.\\\\\" Prior to Oscar night Hartman, who still lived in Youngstown with her mother, commented \\\\\"I\\'m just waiting for someone to offer me a part in a picture or a play. I\\'m climbing the walls, as a matter of fact\\\\\". MGM did not use her picture in their Oscar ads for her but used a sight gag, a pair of sunglasses in a Price Waterhouse envelope.',\n",
       " 'Excellent fun with sadistic humor from Leone.  Eastwood\\'s best performance in a Leone film.  Van Cleef is good in a role similar to Chuck Bronson\\'s in \\\\\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\\\\".  He is menacing and sympathetic, whereas in \\\\\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\\\\" he is just campy and all \\\\\"bad guy\\\\\" (but still fun).  What makes both performances so memorable I think is that Van Cleef seems to be in touch with Leone\\'s dark humor, where Eastwood is used as a straight man.  Volonte is also excellent in the bandito role Leone used (an example of a standard European character type who reminds the audience of earthiness and the basic ignorance and greed of man).  A much better film than most people who\\'ve seen it on a Saturday afternoon on TV probably realize -- you have to see these movies in the theater to get the full hit.',\n",

       " \"A grim long voyage with an earnest script by the remarkable Abby Mann and a respectful Stanley Kramer at the helm. Assorted desperate characters makes the sailing a gripping one.

Simone Signoret's addicted Countess and Vivien Leigh's bitter and disillusioned middle age Southern woman touch and dominate the highest, most powerful moments. Their stories have an immediate resonance and their faces, wonderful, beautiful faces, carry a truth that is as pungent as it is undeniable. Painful yes, very painful but, as it happens with the best kind of drama, entertaining, compelling, cinematic. Jose Ferrer's German bore, George Segal and Elizabeth Ashley and even the wonderful Michael Dunn will make you sea sick at times but I will recommend it nonetheless just to admire and enjoy Vivien Leigh's Charleston or Simone Signoret looking at Oskar Werner with a mixture of love, lust, compassion and need.

The idealism of young people seems to depress him even more which he rips apart towards the end (the highlight of the movie). The bleak look of the movie (it's in B&amp;W) gives it even more of an authentic look and sets the mood for the viewer. There are no explosions, no car chases, no sweeping a woman off her feet......just plain, simple story telling.\",\n",

       " 'Out of the 20 official entries of the James Bond series (to date) \\\\\"Thunderball\\\\\" is often mentioned as \\'the underwater one\\' and for a very good reason. It had big shoes to fill since the previous year\\'s \\\\\"Goldfinger\\\\\" became a box-office phenomenon across the world. Although Thunderball was even more successful, there are debates on weather or not it was a better film. In this fan\\'s opinion, it was.Picking up after the most unusual pre-titles scene featuring MI6 secret agent James Bond meeting his match with a man in drag and escaping in a jet-pack, \\\\\"Thunderball\\\\\" features the most generic (and parodied) Bond plot: The international terrorist organization SPECTRE, led by a mysterious unseen cat stroking leader, hijacks two nuclear bombs for a huge extortion plan. James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to Nassau where Domino Derval (Claudine Auger), the sister of the pilot who appears to be responsible for the theft, resides with her wealthy and older husband Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi). Bond eventually finds out Largo himself is the eye patch wearing SPECTRE #2 and he is in charge of the nuclear warheads. Will he survive Largo\\'s squad, including lethal assassin Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi), and a tank of sharks?\\\\\"Thunderball\\\\\" is directed by Terence Young picking up after Guy Hamilton from the previous film. Young, who directed the first two films of the series, is certainly one of the most important filmmakers of the Bond saga. In the hands of some hack, \\\\\"Thunderball\\\\\" could have easily been an overlong boring disastrous attempt, but Young fills the screen with the same thrilling charm and glamour that made the first two Bonds so unique. The most cinematic of all Fleming novels, the movie is quite faithful to its source material while adding some welcomed changes (the character of Fiona Volpe for example) an therefore making it a more entertaining movie-going experience.The action is mostly underwater and that is what usually divides fans of the series since some find them sleep-inducing. The special effects crew was awarded with a Best Special Effects Oscar in 1966 and for a very good reason. The film\\'s extensive use of underwater photography was quite breath-taking for it\\'s time. And the visual effects themselves are quite impressive, especially the explosion featured in the climax which shattered many windows in Nassau. Thunderball is based mostly on thrills than stunts, which is something recent Bond films should start to concentrate on. It is all well orchestrated to one of John Berry\\'s most memorable contributions to the Bond saga. The \\'007 theme\\' is used at its best during the action sequences, especially during the climatic fight at Largo\\'s yacht. The theme song, sung by Tom Jones, is one of the most memorable tunes of the series, although I prefer the original unused song \\\\\"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\\\\".Two usual standards of the series, villains and girls, are both filled quite successfully. Adolfo Celi is one of the most parodied villains (eye patch anyone?) but his portrayal of #2 is incredibly fun to watch. He is indeed a one-dimensional character, but a very memorable one. Claudine Auger is one stunning-looking woman and her acting skills are above average for the time. She is one of the most likable Bond girls around and her lack of clothing makes her quite heir apparent to Dr. No\\'s Honey Rider in terms of sexiness. But Luciana Paluzzi steals the show with Fiona Volpe. She is the first Bond girl to stand up to the agent\\'s charms (Pussy eventually gave up) and the psychotic look of rage in her eyes responding to Bond\\'s macho insult is particularly memorable: \\'But of course, I forgot your ego, Mr. Bond. James Bond, the one where he has to make love to a woman, and she starts to hear heavenly choirs singing. She repents, and turns to the side of right and virtue... (she steps on Bond\\'s foot)... but not this one!\\' Volpe stands second only to Xenia Onatopp among the sexy girl villains.This is the last time we see Connery at his best portraying 007 before he was eventually bored with the in later entries, particularly in \\\\\"Diamonds are Forever\\\\\". He indeed shows why he is considered by most fans to be the best among the Bonds. He has amazing screen presence and a suave charm of a sophisticated playboy that just makes every guy want to be him and every girl want to be with him.One of my personal favourites and certainly on my top five, \\\\\"Thunderball\\\\\" is one of the most well rounded Bond adventures to date. Exotic locations, beautiful women, battle sequences, gadgets, suspense, terrific music, and a memorable villain add up to the best of the \\\\\"popcorn\\\\\" Bond movies. Terrific entertainment!',\n",
       " \"This film is impossible to understand at once. You need to watch it at least twice to be able to understand something. At first it seems to be an abstract art-house film about a painter in the 15th century, a film which talks about one artist's plight towards his own ideals in difficult times, a philosophical/historical movie. And it may be the part of the great Tarkovsky's intention.Yet as you watch it twice you realize that it is also about religion. And about the ideal of man. The first scene clearly shows how man has always strived to reach towards something higher and how he often failed. This film is also about human nature, as always in Tarkovsky's films. We follow Andrei through his dark and troubled times and adventures and of special importance is the Tatar attack part. Here we see Tarkovsky depict the everlasting hunger for power and the effect it can have on a man. The Russian prince betrays his own country and must stand trial to his own conscience after watching the town of Vladimir get destroyed by the horde of wild Tatars. The scene in the church is also of greater significance, as is the river scene with the pagan festival. They all show the conflict of religions and also moral values.All said, the movie wouldn't be as great without the last part, the one with the boy and the church bell. It illustrates the rebirth of Russia, Christian Russia and the final scene with the hoisting of the bell is one of the best scenes ever in film history. It shows us that faith is a feeble thing;if the bell didn't work, everything would have ended differently. But thanks to a boy's dedication and hard work, the bell tolled and the faith returned to the feeble heads and hearts of people.The miraculous sudden appearance of color in the very end and the wonderful,solemn music really highlight the ultimate message of this film. Which is-art is sacred and immortal and transcends time.At the time of its release, I believe only Tarkovsky himself and perhaps Andrey Kontchalovsky, the co-writer, knew just how great a masterpiece this film really is. It has taken the world some time to discover it, but it was worth it. With perfect acting, specially by Anatoli Solonytsin, perfect music, perfect screenplay and perfect direction, what else can I give it but a perfect 10?\",\n",

And yet, this is a profoundly humanistic, profoundly spiritual, profoundly individualistic and profoundly uncompromising film.

But it is the anguished soul and conscience of this film and of its main hero that truly make this a great picture.There are no cliches here, no stereotypes and no sucking up to the audience. A brutally honest and yet very moving, touching and optimistic film. And it is not about the nature of a genius. Rather, it is about a man's ability and duty to preserve and be true to his humanity, his freedom, his soul, his heart and his gift, no matter what century it is or what the circumstances are.

That is why a simple description of the plot would give the prospective viewer little idea of what the movie is actually about. True, it is the tale of Russia's greatest icon painter. But it is also a rumination on art, the artist, relgion, love, culture, conformity, cruelty, and much more. See it and discuss it with some bright friends.\",\n",

What is certain is that with Balthazar, Bresson entered a form of expression in cinema that is so profound that it almost burns you to watch it.Of course it's not about a donkey, but the sins of the world. And it is a measure of Bresson's staggering achievement that at the end of the film you can actually believe that you have witnessed the sins of the world. And it leaves you not shocked, nor angry - though both emotions are entirely appropriate - but numb with a desperate sadness.On top of all of this, it is also the film which is the subject of probably the finest piece of film criticism in the English language - Andrew Sarris' long and wonderful review of it in The Village Voice on its initial New York release. That ends, 'it stands alone atop one of the loftiest pinnacles of artistically realised emotional experiences.'And so it does.\",\n",
       " 'Is an image really there when you see it in closer zoom-ins? Or does it become even more indistinct, confusing the eye even more? Was there or wasn\\'t there a crime being committed in the middle of the day in a London park? Are there any answers, and is this whole \\\\\"mystery\\\\\" even worth even investigating? These are questions that are the root of the matter, and Michaelangelo Antonioni toys with what happens, and what doesn\\'t happen, what is, what is not, what is real, and what is unreal. The story, if there truly is one, moves slowly and deliberately: David Hemmings portrays an unsympathetic fashion photographer -- he is credited as Thomas but we never hear him called this way -- who seems to wallow in his own prowess as a photographer. He treats women like mincemeat -- to him, they\\'re only objects for his lust as when he meets Veruschka and practically rapes her through a photo shoot -- or mannequins who can\\'t pose worth anything and only fuel his anger. He also has a painter friend who\\'s girlfriend (Sarah Miles) seems to have a certain interest in him, but whom he ignores, like all other women who come in contact with him. After what turns to be a lousy photo shoot he does some meandering and comes to a park, and from a distance witnesses a woman and a man (Vanessa Redgrave and Ronan O\\'Casey), in an apparent, romantic interlude, enjoying the day and the semi-privacy within the park\\'s confines. He takes pictures, walks closer, takes more pictures, walks even closer... almost predatory so, much like a voyeur.That is, until she sees him and demands he return to her the film roll -- he can\\'t take pictures just like that, and is against her consent. He declines so and gives her a different film (after almost having her beg for it). And a little after halfway through the story, he develops his film... and sees what looks to be like a body on the ground, the outline of a man with a gun hidden within some thick bushes. And her reaction, full of angry surprise.Has he truly photographed a murder in progress? Is he privy to more than he should be, and could this have some danger in store for him? Antonioni toys with the audience, never letting in on Redgrave\\'s character, but letting us experience the world through Hemmings untrustworthy eyes and superficial values that momentarily seem to have been thrown out of whack due to this disquieting incident. The problem is, what Hemmings sees may or may not be true -- a classic shot where he tries to find Redgrave and he sees her in the middle of a walking crowd and she literally makes an about-face and disappears from view. Just like that. And his grasp of the mystery emanating from his brush with her at the park, like even Hemmings at the end, is gone, dissolved into the grass.This is not a film for people looking for action and adventure as quite the opposite happens here. It\\'s a film that echoes the French New Wave as it tells a story about an antihero who has a moment of crisis and decides to (maybe) take action, and is left suspended at the end. Influential for Coppola\\'s THE CONVERSATION, this is a fascinating puzzle which is missing its last, vital piece.',\n",

Then add a Commando-league body count, incredible swordplay, and great photography, and you\\'ve got Sword of Doom. This is a wrenching, visceral drama about an antagonist armed not with a stolen nuclear device, but with the best sword-fighting skills in Japan and a psychopath\\'s indifference to human life. Unlike other more recent movies that try to portray the same raw, killing-machine kind of character, Sword of Doom does not resort to grimy photography or an adolescent delight in visual assault.

A young Richard Bradford is extremely believable as the town bully and womanizer. Robert Duvall as a henpecked husband. Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in early roles. The real reason to catch this one, however, is Brando's performance, which (as noted by another reviewer) is one of his better ones. I saw this movie when it was released and left the theater feeling exhaustion as well as an inner turmoil because the movie made me so mad!

       " \"This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. This was unique; 3 people?! You can't do that. But Leone did, and he did it brilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too many times to count but I'll be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo, someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.\",\n",
       " '...and though those last several words could also be attributed to Leone\\'s \\\\\"Once Upon a Time\\\\\" films (West and America) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of Dollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There\\'s something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that\\'s nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it\\'s craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or \\'Angel Eyes\\', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year old Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his \\'buddy\\' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later, the situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn\\'t, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe, that they\\'re executed in the mind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan &amp; scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it\\'s practically a must to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone\\'s original cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it\\'s still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); Cleef\\'s cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he\\'s in; ditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer\\'s. If anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it\\'s Wallach - especially as he gets the most \\'character\\', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn\\'t work quite as well, surprisingly enough. Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it\\'s an endearing bravo to all who were involved.',\n",

With his long, thin opening eyes, deathly pale face and cruel voice, Lee Van Cleef is the merciless bounty hunter, ironically called \\'Angel Eyes,\\' always ready to kill for a price...The \\'Ugly\\' is Eli Wallach, a wild spirit with devil attitude... Tuco is charming but extremely dangerous...The pairing of Eastwood and Wallach is memorable for its black humor alternating each other\\'s fate, motivated satisfactorily by their excessive desire for collecting the reward money... The quest: a treasure chest containing $200,000 in gold buried in a Confederate grave in Sad Hill Cemetery...\\\\\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\\\\" had many haunting moments: Complicated bounty-hunter\\'s con-games; the Stranger, in a frantic hurry, trying to load his empty gun before 3 killers sent by Tuco; a torturous walk across the desert in a blazing sun; the epic battle between Union and Confederate soldiers for the control of a strategic bridge where Leone\\'s camera takes a slow ride surveying the magnitude of the Civil War carnage; and the final showdown in a huge graveyard, where each character, naturally, wants the money all to himself...The amusing scenes are provided by Tuco, sitting in bathtub with a lot of foam and one armed man enters his room saying: \\\\\"I\\'ve been looking for you for 8 months... Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me...\\\\\"The memorable scenes are when the Stranger finds himself in a dangerous situation at the hand of Tuco, who is just about to collect his vengeance by hanging his former partner...

Tensions mounts as the three protagonists \\'shape in a triangular cinema clich\\\\u00e9\\' Leone gets the audience\\'s imagination with a geometric fight to the death, accompanied by a clear exciting music...

Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie.

This gray, sandy, grainy landscape illustrates the film's misery best of all - it is not captivating, nor does it manage to hold attention for a speck of time. It just rags along ploddingly and leaves no place for any serious delivery or dynamics. Do not watch this meddle, waste of time merely\",\n",

Allow me to surmise a bit of history: having created two of the greatest westerns ever with \\\\\"A Fistful of Dollars\\\\\" and \\\\\"For A Few Dollars More\\\\\", some unscrupulous soul was able to convince Sergio Leone that he was a creator of great cinema, instead of a creator of great westerns; this movie was the result. Gone are the brilliantly set-up action sequences, replaced with senseless and dull confrontations, with size, not even quantity, trying to make up for the lost quality. Gone are the witty and interesting characters and the deep character development, replaced with annoying, inconsistent, and flat caricatures. As to just what Leone was trying to say with this movie, for clearly he felt it had a message, it is either horribly unclear or completely and pathetically trite. In his quest to make a movie with meaning, Leone cast aside what had made this movie\\'s \\\\\"predecessors\\\\\" so wonderful, and found that not only did he lose the bird in his hand, but he couldn\\'t catch the ones in the bush and fell in a pile of excrement in trying.',\n",
       " \"Is this film supposed to be a comedy ? (eg with Eli Wallach from the New York classical school of over acting). If so, it is in poor taste with the butchery of the civil war prominent. The civil war was not fought on the sand dunes of Spain. Moreover, able-bodied young men in civilian dress would not be able to freely prance around in the civil war 'theatre'. Clint is burnt to a cinder in the sun and yet within a few days has a baby soft complexion. Eli is beaten to a pulp and yet somehow manages to keep all his teeth and his engaging smile. A overlong, overrated lot of nonsense. Clint only made three good westerns: Josey Wales, Pale Rider , High Plains Drifter. The only Leone western worthy of a repeat viewing is For a Few dollars More due to Lee Van Clef , a better script and better music.My advice, stick to John Wayne, Randolph Scott and Audie Murphy.\",\n",

It made no sense whatsoever. The context of the film had already been established earlier, when Blondie and Tuco are put into a POW camp (and meet up with Angel Eyes -- moving the plot forward), but this scene is worthless.  All of a sudden, any momentum that the film might have had is diffused by this \\\\\"statement\\\\\" that war is meaningless.  It is as obvious as an Oliver Stone film, and as off-putting. By the time the film gets back on track, one finds it difficult to care, and the three way showdown between the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, with its long shifting eyeball shots, plays like a satire on the classical western. If that is the point, then why is the majority of the film up to that point played straight?Other Sergio Leone films are better than this one.',\n",

Given that the book was written in 1949 and \\\\\"Harper\\\\\" was contemporary (1966) when made, the movie follows the novel pretty darn close. Many of the scenes are done almost verbatim from the book. Harper is more acerbic than Macdonald\\'s Lew Archer, and the novel, of course, fleshes out the characters and their motives a little better. But I think the movie stands up pretty well by itself. It has an outstanding supporting cast and, except for Pamela Tiffin, the acting is good, with high marks especially for Paul Newman and, in my opinion, Arthur Hill.

       " 'A Man For All Seasons is an erudite examination of the old Biblical maxim: a man cannot serve two masters. Sir Thomas More (poignantly portrayed by Paul Scofield) struggles to be true to both his faith and his monarch (the lusty and hearty King Henry VIII superbly played by Robert Shaw). I think it is difficult for citizens in our present secular society to truly understand just how central a role religion played in a man\\'s life during the period of the film; it was an age of faith when Christianity exerted the most powerful of influences on one\\'s thinking. On a side note, the American Republic wisely sought a nation that \\\\\"divided church and state.\\\\\" However, the fine distinction remains that it would be a state informed by faith but not run by the church. The aforementioned exemplary performances by the leads are backed by excellent supporting turns, especially from Orson Welles as the less than saintly Cardinal Wolsey and the eternally ebullient Susannah York as Sir Thomas\\'s daughter Margaret.

       " 'When talking of Bergman, critics and viewers usually name Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, Cries and Whispers ahead of Persona. While those films are all amazing and stay very high on my list of all time favorites, for me, the truly unique and inspirational s \\'Persona\\' - Bergman\\'s enigmatic masterpiece.The story is seemingly simple: \\\\\"A nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), has been assigned to care for a famous actress, Elizabeth (Liv Ullman), who suddenly stopped speaking during a performance of Electra and has remained silent ever since. When they go to stay in a seaside house owned by Alma\\'s psychiatrist colleague, the apparently self-confident nurse gradually reveals more and more of herself in the face of Elizabeth\\'s silence, and is shocked to read a letter the actress has written implying that Alma is an interesting case-study. The two women seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one (strikingly expressed visually in a famous shot); in a dream sequence (or perhaps fantasy), Elizabeth\\'s husband comes to visit and seems to think that Alma is his wife. Finally Alma, back in her nurse\\'s uniform, catches a bus to go home, leaving the almost-mute Elizabeth alone.\\\\\"Whether Alma was able to get her identity back remains one of the film\\'s many questions. What is absolutely wonderful in the film \\\\u0096 performances from two actresses. Anderson is the one who has to carry almost the entire dialog, her voice is one of the film\\'s priceless treasures while Ullman is equally powerful in expressing hundreds of emotions through her face and eyes. Sven Nykvist\\'s camera, the third star of the film makes two stars shine so bright.Each scene in 81 minutes long film is memorable, some of them just unforgettable. For instance, the long scene where Alma reveals her most intimate memories of a sexual encounter with two boys while sunbathing nude with another girl on an empty beach, is infinitely more erotic to listen to than it would have been to see in flashback. There is so much to think about in Persona. One major question concerns Elizabeth\\'s silence: is it elective, as happens in Tarkovsky\\'s \\\\\"Andrei Rublyov\\\\\" , or is it some kind of mental breakdown?. The documentaries about the war horrors that Elizabeth watches on TV suggest the former; the fact that it suddenly happens during a stage performance of \\\\\"Electra\\\\\" suggests the latter. I keep thinking about it. Why \\\\\"Electra\\\\\" of all plays? The story of the daughter who hated her mother and wanted her dead \\\\u0096 does it reflect the accusation brought up by Alma that Elizabeth did not love her deformed son and wanted him dead? Did Elizabeth become so overwhelmed by guilt realizing that her life reminded so much of Electra\\'s story? We don\\'t know for sure, and Bergman does not help. The identical monologue in which Alma is accusing Elizabeth is the film\\'s resolution. We hear it twice: first time, camera is concentrating on Elizabeth\\'s face, second time \\\\u0096 on Alma\\'s. Is Alma talking about Elizabeth or herself or both? After that encounter on the beach, Alma became pregnant and had an abortion. The monologue may reflect her feelings of guilt and emptiness as well as Elizabeth\\'s. Does it really happen? Is Elizabeth a vampire sucking the life out of her victims only to use them as characters for her acting roles? Is that the ultimate price the artist is paying for being a great artist? Does he need lives and souls of others to be able to create? Can he/she love the ones who utterly depend on them and need their love? This film and later Autumn Sonata (1978) with Ingrid Bergman as a concert pianist show famous stars as selfish women who can\\'t and don\\'t love their children. The same question was brought up also in the earlier \\\\\"Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\\\\\" - in the relationship of the writer and his daughter. Then there is the question of whether there are really two women at all; could the whole film be played out as a fantasy of one of them, or indeed of somebody else? Is there a sexual attraction between the two women? It might be or might be not. I believe, David Lynch has watched \\\\\"Persona\\\\\" very carefully, thought about it and used some of its ideas in his own \\\\\"Mullholland Dr.\\\\\" There are so many questions in this incredible film that are left unanswered. For almost forty years, viewers and filmmakers alike have been trying to find the answers. One thing is obvious \\\\u0096 this is one of the films you want to watch over and over again. I think it should be seen by any viewer. If you\\'ve seen it already \\\\u0096 see it again. You\\'ll learn something new. If you have not seen it \\\\u0096 you are in for a great experience. See it for Sven Nykvist\\'s camera work, for Liv\\'s face, for Bibi\\'s voice, for the unique and mysterious world that is Ingmar Bergman\\'s universe.',\n",
       " 'When I viewed PERSONA recently, I didn\\'t know what exactly to make of it: what was it telling me, what was its intentions, its ultimate meaning. Not being a conventional director by far, I felt that Bergman had deliberately left all this 81 minute of storytelling to me to figure out... and I may have been right, but I either wasn\\'t getting it or this was too much of an abstract film to merit any analysis, so my review was at face value and even ended with the sentence \\\\\"this is exactly how Bergman wants it.\\\\\" Seeing it later more emerges, and the deeper story takes place even if it still seems linear: Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) loses her speech midway through Electra and will not speak again (except once throughout the entire film, and in an imagined sequence). There is no apparent reason as to why she has lost her speech, and the only hint is the horror she witnesses on the television as war, genocide, and destruction rage on. Other than that it is never alluded to, her muteness.Into the picture comes Alma (Bibi Andersson), the nurse who is put to her care by the suggestion of a psychiatrist. Both retreat to an isolated home. Seeing that Elisabeth will not talk, Alma fills space and time with her own erratic ramblings that take shape and form, a need to fill a void, and that void is of course, Elisabeth, who listens and listens and listens impassively yet with interest. Alma\\'s stories are a form of confession: if Elisabeth is the mute who bears the scars of the world, Alma is the conveyor who purges inner traumas and erotic experiences, hurtful on a lesser scale. The fact she has been laid so naked to the woman she is trying to rehabilitate and the fact she learns this very woman considers her an interesting subject suddenly shocks her: from being caring, she turns vindictive. A shard of glass left deliberately to have Elisabeth step over is the catalyst: the images break, abstract images take place again, and the story re-starts. But one wonders, what if Elisabeth stepped over the glass with equal deliberateness? After all, she does need Alma. And she is an actress foremost. This moment is the one that amps up the tension between the women and even then they become closer, so close Elisabeth\\'s husband thinks Alma is her as Elisabeth quietly allows this to happen. Is Elisabeth re-living some form of event through Alma? Is Alma the only way another secret involving Elisabeth\\'s child can come through? Whatever the reason, Alma is clearly a conduit for Elisabeth to come forth and the merging of their similar faces is the culmination of this haunting psycho-drama that goes beyond its cinematic boundaries. No clear resolutions except the almost casual references that explain both women\\'s return to their own sense of normalcy, but this somehow inconclusive ending is what gives it the weight of a great story and excellent Bergman. Reality here is what is so common to us: who we see ourselves as, how others see us, how self-identification becomes self-preservation through the experiences of others, good or bad or a combination of both. Pain and ecstasy are a part of our make-up, and PERSONA is the best example of the merging of the two.',\n",

The ending is one of the most horrific sequences I\\'ve ever seen. I felt like bolting from the theatre.A one-of-kind horror thriller. I can\\'t say I enjoyed this, but I\\'ll never forget it. It has a big deserved cult following.',\n",
       " \"Hitchcock made a few clunkers in his day, but this isn't one of them, despite its reputation. I don't know if I could get away with saying it's one of Hitchcock's ten best features, but I found it to be easily one of his top ten most entertaining. I enjoyed watching Torn Curtain a lot more than some of his established classics, like Notorious and the Birds, even if it's not quite as psychologically complex as those films.The main thing about Torn Curtain is the photography. It's full of pretty pictures--one of the most beautifully filmed of all Hitchcock's films, with lots bold swaths of primary colors and attractive and constantly changing locations--some scenes look like they were shot on location, while others are wonderfully artificial studio creations, and they're blended together perfectly. Another cool thing about Torn Curtain is that it's constantly on the move. It never stagnates. The pacing is deliberate, but engaging. It's well-plotted and suspenseful.It's full of fantastic little directorial touches, like the scene where Paul Newman ducks into a bathroom to read his secret spy message. Hitchcock never shows us the room. He keeps the camera tight on Paul Newman, so we can't tell who or what might be in that room with us, just out of frame. It's totally simple, but it creates a highly effective feeling of uneasiness and paranoia. This movie also features one of the strangest and best-filmed death scenes I've ever seen. Hitchcock was still on top of his game here.Most of the bad reviews for Torn Curtain seem to focus on the acting. I don't know why.A lot of people bash Julie Andrews just for being Julie Andrews, and that hardly seems fair. Typecasting sucks. And while I wouldn't say she turned in one of the most memorable and overpowering performances of all time, her role didn't call for that. Torn Curtain wasn't a complex character study, it was a plot-based thriller. And Julie Andrews was perfectly adequate for that, even pretty good when she was given a chance to be.Paul Newman was perfect. He wasn't his usual charming self here. He was grim and tight-lipped and stiff--as would be appropriate for a scientist feeling out of his league, playing a spy in a hostile country, having to pretend to be a traitor--a role which he found objectionable--all with his girlfriend annoyingly tagging along and complicating everything.I understand that Paul Newman found working for Hitchcock objectionable. It makes me wonder if Hitch deliberately made life unpleasant for Paul just to get this kind of tooth-gritting performance from him. Whatever, Hitch and Paul were both great.And so was this film.\",\n",
       " \"Severine is a beautiful young lady belonging to the bourgeoisie society, married to a doctor, Pierre. Though she loves her husband, something stops her from going to bed with him. She is apparently troubled, and has erotic fantasies, with her husband always playing the bad guy - tormenting her. The director is very cunning in sprinkling some scenes from Severine's childhood which actually give a lot of clue regarding her troubled life. One such scene depicts her being abused by an elderly man (probably her father). This in my opinion is very revealing and makes our understanding of Severine's other actions/imaginations even better. She always considered herself impure, and was ashamed of letting her husband know that. This can be seen in one such sprinkler scenes where the girl Severine refuses to accept the holy offerings from the Father in the Church. And this scene is very aptly placed while Severine is found going up the stairs of the brothel to take up the job as a prostitute.Having been abused by an elderly man in her childhood, Severine, justifiably doesn't enjoy an young man's company in the bed (her husband). And she has erotic fantasies about going to bed with elderly clients at the brothel....again taking a job at the brothel is a fantasy and NOT real. This is very evident from the very funny, illogical incidents that take place in the brothel.Into her fantasies walks a young man and she had to please him on the bed at the brothel. While she lay on the bed, the young man notices a mark on her and queries her about it. When Severine says its just a birth mark (remember...this is analogous to the impurity she is carrying with her from her childhood), the young man initially rejects her (she thinks her husband would similarly reject her for her impurity) but finally gives in and enjoys her. Only then she realises that, the young man also bears a scar on his back, which he says is from a knife stab. She realises, everyone has a scar to be reconciled with in life. This gives her a great sense of relief and her attitude towards her husband slowly changes. In her fantasies, however, Severine sees a conflict between the young client and her husband, and that the young man kills her husband in a fit of rage, only to be killed in turn by the policeman. She ends the life of the young client in her fantasies. She confides in a family friend (who is actually shown as one more client at the brothel) and she is relieved that the husband knows the truth. This leads to a better understanding of her husband and a new relationship blossoms. Now, the husband, whom Severine thought was nothing but a crippled man, blind, and unyielding,she realises that she had in fact only imagined all that and puts an end to her fantasies, symbolised by the empty coach driven in the last scene.\",\n",
       " \"My other favorite Bunuel films, _The Exterminating Angel_ and _The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie_, are in some ways social satires surrealistically told. _Belle de Jour_, however, is much more of a purely surreal work, which is appropriate since it is about two of the most surreal of subjects: power, and sex. Don't watch it expecting psychedelic camera tricks and Freudian dream sequences - Bunuel is much too controlled for trickery, and much too tricky to allow you to calmly map out what is real and what is not. And don't expect to know exactly what has happened at the end or even to remember the film clearly later. Each time I see it again I discovered that that the film has somehow reassembled itself in my memory, so each viewing is fresh and surprising. Even if you don't give a tinker's melted watch about surrealism, and don't care to puzzle out reality from fantasy, there's still much to like here: frequent droll humor, a little bit of titillation, and a good performance from an incredibly beautiful young Catherine Deneuve. Watch it with someone you love.\",\n",
       " \"Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.\",\n",
       " \"I saw this film for the first time in September 1968, after working for just one year as a professional cinematographer. I rapidly saw it five more times, in order to observe technical details of the photography of the film, but every time I completely forgot to look at those details, since I became so absorbed by the film every time. Now, after more than 35 years as a cinematographer and film teacher, I still marvel at Mike Nichols' and Robert Surtees' work every time I see the film. Almost everything you can do with a camera can be seen in this film, and everything is perfectly right for the story. The Graduate is groundbreaking in more areas than the photography. The casting, writing, acting, picture and sound editing are all exceptionally good, and have influenced film-making ever since. I was very happy when I saw that The Graduate reached the 7th position in the American Film Institute's voting of the best American films in history.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve seen a great many films, but \\'In Cold Blood\\' stands alone in a class by itself.  It excels in every department.  The fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee.  Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo.  The fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place, even inside the very house,  add additional chills.  The black/white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent.  There are many outstanding cinematic works out there, but if I could only vote for one to top the list, it would most probably be \\\\\"In Cold Blood\\\\\".',\n",
       " \"I found this to be a pretty solid western, not one you hear a lot about but a fast- moving film which means it entertains. It doesn't dawdle on any one particular scene.There is a good cast in this Clint Eastwood-starred movie. Pat Hingle did an outstanding job as the too gung-ho judge but isn't all bad and has an interesting explanation of the situation he was in near the end of the film.Overall, this a gritty story with Eastwood in his customary revenge-minded role, although he mellows somewhat by the end of the film. I also appreciated all the good facial closeups in here. As with most westerns, the movie is nicely photographed. This movie had a odd combination of being really raw in parts but yet thoughtful. I think it's a very underrated, under-appreciated western.\",\n",
       " 'Never before has cinema been this simple and honest.  No one makes films with more emotion than Bresson and no one puts less emotion in their films than he.  I could cite so many Bressonian cliches and talk of his uniquely personal style which by 1967 was firmly established, especially since he had abandoned the voice-over he used in the 50s.  I will point out his use of sound and approach to acting which remain so distinctive and by now so familiar.  There is nothing in Mouchette that is new, especially after Balthazar, what remains is the story of Mouchette, told with the utter grace and passion that makes this film a masterpiece that transcends technique, even cinema itself, and makes most cinema look frivolous in the process.Finally I must mention the films ending, which I rank with that of Balthazar as the most beautiful I have seen.',\n",

       " '\\\\\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\\\\" was recognized by John Huston himself as his most important film of his late period along with \\\\\"The Man who would be a King\\\\\".

       " \"To see how beautiful, moving, exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is, to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made, arguably the most perfect, it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \\\\nHis only contact with people is in the preparation of death; his is a sterile, self-negating existence, ascetic as a monk (his uniform as ritual vestments).  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror. At these moments, allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is, of course, linked to all this.  Over the credits, Jef smokes alone in his bedroom, barely visible - the two bright windows look like eyes, as in Beckett's 'End Game', a figure for the mind, a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot, contracting and constricting the room to breaking point, revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven, and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies - the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ; when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract, his accomplice, lit by a lamp, looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.\",\n",

       " 'A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick\\'s magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn\\'t concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I\\'ve never seen a person say, \\\\\"2001: A Space Odyssey? I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?\\\\\", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you \\\\\"get it\\\\\" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is \\\\\"...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness.\\\\\" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that\\'s sheer genius at its highest form.At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, \\\\\"Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?\\\\\" The New York Times remarked, \\\\\"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.\\\\\" \\\\\"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\\\\\" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 \\\\\"trash masquerading as art\\\\\". It\\'s understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for \\\\\"if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning\\\\\", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause \\\\\"cultural shock and social disorientation\\\\\". It\\'s a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.Yet apes are not much better. They\\'re not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There\\'s something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that\\'s so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing \\\\\"Daisy\\\\\" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity\\'s fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn\\'t have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous \\\\\"Star Gate\\\\\" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo\\'s The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a \\\\\"Space Baby\\\\\", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it\\'s a question for you to answer.There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001\\'s composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky\\'s work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick\\'s artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.But of course, it\\'s impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it\\'s hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what\\'s the point? You don\\'t need me to appreciate 2001\\'s immaculate visuals.Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, \\\\\"North\\'s (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.\\\\\"\\\\\"But why all the slow parts?\\\\\" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity\\'s fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot\\'s average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would\\'ve been a mess. Space isn\\'t fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it\\'s now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI \\\\\"Sight and Sound\\\\\" Critics\\' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director\\'s poll, places 15th on AFI\\'s 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of \\\\\"greatest science-fiction films of all time\\\\\".2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it\\'s transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them.

The storytelling is so simple yet so powerful and the acting is of such a high order that it seems timeless despite being a Historical Drama set in the 12th century.Set on the course of one night, King Henry II (Peter O\\'Toole) has a family reunion to see who of his three sons will be his successor to the throne, although he has his eyes set on John (Nigel Terry), but his imprisoned wife, Queen Eleanor of Acquitaine (played to perfection by Katharine Hepburn) has other plans which involve her own favorite, Richard (Anthony Hopkins in his film debut). Matters get complicated when neglected son Geoffrey (John Castle) pretends to be on John\\'s side to serve his own interests and when Eleanor encounters Henry\\'s mistress Alais (Jane Merrow) and will not cede the Acquitaine to Henry. Into the mix is a revelation from newly appointed King Philip of France (Timothy Dalton) in which he states that Richard had raped him (when in fact they had had an affair). Floating above the overlapping intrigues is Henry, not quite able to decide just what will the course of action to take, and when he learns that his sons have been conspiring to overthrow him (thanks to Eleanor), he almost gets painted into a corner and makes an impossible decision.This is a fascinating story, written so eloquently and performed so powerfully on-screen that one forgets this was originally a stage play with Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris in the leads. No sumptuous decorations; this, while being a family of noble extraction, they live devoid of the commodities that one would imagine coming from them. Of course, chemistry just overflows whenever Hepburn and O\\'Toole are together on-screen; it makes one think of the best matches in cinema history and is a shame they never worked together again as she was fond of him. If anything, they alone are the movie and never for a moment does one get bored even though the only \\\\\"action\\\\\" sequence is a scene where O\\'Toole drags Merrow to force her to marry Hopkins while Hepburn quietly monitors them. A beautiful film, timeless in its theme of family and inheritances, with shrewd performances, the best movie for 1968.',\n",
       " \"Night of the Living Dead is a true classic and without a doubt Romero's best and most influential film.Of course, being simply influential alone would not simply allow this movie to get a full-fledged star rating if it didn't pull through with it some quality at all, which it does in spades. In Night of the Living Dead, there is good pacing, surprisingly good acting from a list of no-name actors, and the most important part that sticks with the film to this day, the sense of dread in the film. In this movie to this day you get that feeling of hopelessness, people get attacked for no reason and nothing can save them. Whether it's family-togetherness, love between a couple, or even the law-enforcers at the end, this was all tapping into the uncertainty level people were having at the time and still today it has meaning. Topping this off with Romero's (at the time) large use of gore adds to the overall uneasiness of the film. Finally at the film's current times, there is a great subtle final nail in the coffin attack with the sad fate of the character Ben. Being the only sole voice of reason is shot, which, at the time of filming brought harsh realities of such other African-American leaders who were brought down unfairly such as Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, even if this wasn't the original idea Romero had.Overall, no matter how cheesy some of this movie make look to modern eyes, Night of the Living Dead is a classic for offering horror without a shred of hope, forever influencing every horror movie in it's wake.\",\n",
       " \"What can you say about Peter Sellers? From the Goon Show, through the Ealing comedies, the Pink Panther films, up to Being There, he was consistently brilliant! Kubrick knew it, Blake Edwards knew it, and this movie does a lot to prove it to everyone else. Instead of making his stereotype just a vehicle for laughs, he brings out the pathos and beauty inherent in alienation..instead of using scripted antique gags as an invitation to walk through the role, he transcends each tired joke with impeccable timing and facial expressions. Even the silly sixties situations don't ruin the comedy here, as they did in Alice B. Toklas. In my opinion, this one is timeless, and should be seen by anyone who has a sense of humor.\",\n",
       " '1968s PLANET OF THE APES has been my favorite film since I first saw it in April of that year when I was eight years old. The movie had a huge impact back then and I cannot emphasize more the power to grip the imagination it had -- and has -- and the shock the final image of the movie was back then. I literally left the theatre stunned and speechless. No other movie of my youth had such impact, or created such suspension of disbelief. Over the past thirty-four years PLANET OF THE APES has attained classic status and it\\'s a tribute to the film\\'s excellence that there are so many comments left here on the Internet Movie Database that this film is better than the viewer thought it would be, or that it wasn\\'t campy or cheesy as they\\'d always thought, or that it was more intelligent and thought-provoking than most films they\\'ve ever seen, and that despite the studio stupidly putting the final shot -- one of the most famous last shots in the history of American cinema -- on the cover of the video, they were still stunned and haunted by it.PLANET OF THE APES is based on a 1963 French novel, \\\\\"La planete des singes,\\\\\" by Pierre Boulle, most famous as the author of \\\\\"La pont de la riviere Kwai\\\\\" (1952), which became the 1957 film THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The story tells of a French journalist, Ulysse Merou, who, in the year 2500 travels with two companions in a near-light speed spacecraft to the red-giant star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. There they find a sister planet to earth, Soror, and after landing on a remote plateau discover a race of human beings that are no more than animals, naked and unable to speak. The three earthmen are stripped of there clothes by the humans, who hate anything that isn\\'t natural. Their spacecraft is destroyed by the savage people and they are run off into the jungle. The next morning the tribe of wild humans are attacked by hunters, who are gorillas dressed like men, hunting like men, and acting and speaking like men. One of the earthmen is killed, another disappears, and Merou is captured, taken to a research lab, and subjected to scientific experiments.A sympathetic female animal psychologist, Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee, is intrigued by Merou keenness and soon learns that this man is highly intelligent and able to learn speech. With her help Merou learns all about the simian civilization on Soror, in which the apes live in modern cities, drive cars, fly planes, and watch TV, and where conservative orangutans, especially one named Zaius, so fear this intelligent human being that they seek to have him destroyed. With the help of Zira\\'s fiance, an archeologist named Cornelius, Merou unwittingly discovers a secret about the origins of intelligent life on Soror that\\'s so dangerous he\\'s forced to flee the planet of the apes and return to earth.Boulle\\'s novel is a satire in the tradition of Voltaire that mocks humankind\\'s anthropocentric theory of the universe from which human beings derive their sense of importance, and is laced with the kind of harrowing ironies that Boulle was famous for.The movie based on this book is an \\'Americanized\\' adaptation of it. Rod Serling did the first drafts of the screenplay, simplifying the plot by fitting it into the mold of his \\\\\"Twilight Zone\\\\\" TV series and introducing an anti-nuclear war theme not present in the Boulle novel. Because of budget constraints the modern ape civilization had to be reduced to a less technological one, something more reminiscent of ancient Greece. In fact, after Michael Wilson, who had also adapted Boulle\\'s \\\\\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\\\\" to the screen, was brought in to do the final script drafts what emerged was a political allegory more akin to an Aesop fable than a Voltairian satire.An improvement on the book was to turn the Merou character, now named Taylor, into a misanthrope and to reduce the scope of the story into a kind of \\'misanthrope\\'s comeuppance.\\' Charlton Heston was a perfect choice to play the unlikable American astronaut, having essayed such similar \\'bastard\\' roles in 1954s THE NAKED JUNGLE, 1963s DIAMOND HEAD and 1963s 55 DAYS AT PEKING, and the movie would be a lot less funny and pointed without him.Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, as Cornelius and Zira, and Maurice Evans, as Dr. Zaius, enjoy some of the best performances on the screen, bringing the then-innovative makeup design of John Chambers to life under the intelligent and stylish direction of Franklin J. Schaffner. Also excellent in this Arthur P. Jacobs production for 20th Century-Fox is the veteran cinematographer Leon Shamroy\\'s Panavision lensing, which makes great use of remote areas of southern Utah around Lake Powell to suggest an alien world, and Jerry Goldsmith\\'s avant-garde musical score, which has become a landmark, cannot be emphasized more for contributing to the weird atmosphere and eerie mood of the movie. Rarely has a movie score so fit like hand-in-glove than this one.PLANET OF THE APES was a box office smash in 1968, but if ever there was a movie that was more a victim of its own success it\\'s this one. Four sequels, two TV series, numerous novelizations and comic book adventures, and a lamentable remake in 2001 have been spawned by its popularity, most of which has been so inferior in quality to have tarnished the reputation of this classy and intelligent SF film landmark. Luckily the qualities of the film remind viewers again and again of what noted New Yorker movie critic Pauline Kael titled her review of this movie, \\\\\"Apes must be remembered, Charlie!\\\\\"',\n",
       " 'No one I know under 40 had seen this film, though we all joked about it as being a stereotypical \\\\\"bad\\\\\" film based on rumors. the title, and clips seen here and there.  Finally one weekend when I was working until 2:00 a.m. I went home and there was a sequel on late night TV, during the 30 year Planet of the Apes marathon.  It made me curious about the original and I tracked it down.  I have to say it blew me away!The film is philosophical, creative, absorbing and scary.  Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.  So far I haven\\'t even been able to convince my friends to see it because there seems to be such a strong prejudice against it and some sort of entrenched belief it must be bad; in fact it is one of the finest films I\\'ve seen and I can see why it is a classic.If you enjoy films that make you think you simply can\\'t dislike Planet of the Apes.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s especially interesting that \\\\\"Planet of the Apes\\\\\" was released a few months before \\\\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\\\\", as they both look at the same question: what will become of humanity (and how did we originate)? Obviously, the really famous line is Charlton Heston\\'s snap at his captors, and the really famous scene is the end - which I won\\'t tell here for fear of spoiling the whole movie. And what an impressive movie it is! Unfortunately, I can\\'t say the same for Tim Burton\\'s remake. \\\\\"POTA\\\\\" should never have been remade. So, for a cinematic treat, stick to this one and avoid the remake.One more thing is that some people have pointed out that the portrayals of the simians were kinda racist. The blond, cultured orangutans are the nobles; the dark-haired, mildly nervous chimpanzees are the scientists; and the dark-skinned, incompetent gorillas are the police. Oh well. It\\'s still a good movie.',\n",
       " \"Really unbelievable this film is stated as horror/comedy here on IMDb. Braindead is horror/comedy. This is pure horror. If Kopfrkringl's sick mind doesn't scare you, nothing does. This is a holocaust movie. But unlike Pianist or Shindler's list this movie is about cremator. About man who finds idea of burning thousands of murdered people every day very attractive. Director Juraj Herz have done brilliant piece of work by creating atmosphere of fear and madness so deep and believable. Because in fact there had to be some Kopfrkringl who actually done these things during WW2. This movie flows like honey (or some Lynch's work) with no boring spots and no disturbances in its rhythm. One scene traverses into another almost seamlessly. And in the end you can see mass murderer who thinks he is dalailama and you'll believe it's possible. That's why Cremator is REAL horror.\",\n",
       " 'Had I known this junk was populated with a bunch of second rate Brit players I would have run for the hills. Extremely dull fare with lots of shrill, rapid talking limey accents and not a whole lot of anything else.

       " \"One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film, since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them: shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers, even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form, since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day. The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner (Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight, a visiting friend observes), and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone; the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby, sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film: Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch, a friend of theirs, about the horrific past of the house they're now living in, a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide (really a suicide?), Guy, an actor, gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind, and Hutch, who might have found something out that would help Rosemary, suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later; all these (and a few other) events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film, while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works, makes sense and is observant, slightly (but only slightly) funny and very disturbing, all at once. Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever: Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet, always friendly, but also giving you the feeling that, hidden behind her generosity, she actually follows her own, obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbor, you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet. So, if you think a real horror film needs shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers or at least blood - watch Rosemary's Baby and you'll change your mind.\",\n",
       " 'Pregnancy is the time in a woman\\'s life that, despite the hormone imbalance and the emotional changes, is charged in an overwhelming among of love and support and the notion that she is slowly gestating a human life, male or female, a child that will bring her (and her family) happiness. Motherhood has been depicted as beautiful, symbolic, Woman being Creation in progress in ancient cultures, a Thing to venerate and respect and even worship, Something capable of ensuring the continuation of a family line, a tradition, and hence, life and culture for an entire strata of society. Nothing is supposed to go wrong, or at least, not at the level of what happens to Rosemary Woodhouse\\'s pregnancy, which is the ultimate wrong thing.What Ira Levin seems to want to tell us in this \\\\\"plot\\\\\" surrounding Rosemary\\'s pregnancy is that society and its religious tradition can be substituted by something much more sinister, as-yet unseen but gestant -- the force of will, the creation of Man\\'s own version of what he believes will be the new wave of humanity. Is God dead? Well, considering the timing of the novel and the movie with society\\'s disillusionment with Establishment, the onset of Vietnam, the loss of innocence of a country just years ago with the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, He just as well may be. Religion and religious figures pop up during the movie, but seem unable to bring any comfort and only add to the vague sense of unease that permeates ROSEMARY\\'S BABY.And this nagging unease is precisely what both author and director give us: something not quite, completely there, something that seems to be happening just off-limits, barely overheard through the flimsy walls which divide these prewar apartment buildings converted into chic, livable spaces. The way the banal elements that are so much a part of our lives are overthrown so subtly makes the horror that is the movie\\'s denouement even more tragic. Surely the nice neighbors can\\'t be more than just that -- they\\'re so helpful... well, maybe a little too helpful. Surely the death of that girl Rosemary befriends was just a freak suicide. Surely the doctor\\'s recommendations for Rosemary are the best -- don\\'t doctor\\'s always know what\\'s good for us? And surely, one\\'s own partner would not have done the unthinkable in order to advance professionally now, would he?Paranoia of the unseen is a powerful way to tell a horror story without ever giving away any shock cuts or showing the boogeyman. While it becomes abundantly clear early on that this is a story of witchcraft of the worst kind, the only time some of it makes its way in front of the camera is in the extremely stylized ritual/rape scene, and even then, since Rosemary is having what might be the worst nightmare of her life, one isn\\'t quite sure of what is happening, and of course, in the end, when all is revealed in a comic yet horrific way. That takes skill in a storyteller and what makes ROSEMARY\\'S BABY so completely disturbing even now, almost forty years from its release unto the public. Also the fact that it never relies on a twist ending so common today but on the nuanced performance of the actors portraying real urbanites enhances: from Mia Farrow who carries the movie and even at the end retains a resigned innocence to her fate once her suspicions are facts to John Cassavettes who plays his part slimy straight, and supporting actors Ruth Gordon and Sydney Blackmer who have the hard task of making kindly and eccentric hide sinister just underneath. Their performance makes you wonder who exactly are your neighbors, and if they might be harboring some deadly lifestyle, and makes you feel uneasy being alone even in an empty hallway or accepting anyone\\'s offered smoothie.',\n",
       " '\\\\\"The Swimmer\\\\\" is a one of a kind movie, adapted from a John Cheever short story.The Film opens with the sound of footsteps moving through the woods accompanied by a low eerie music. Occasionally animals and scenes of nature both in daylight and at night come into the cameras focus. The camera moves along looking at trees, a lake and the wildlife clearly representing what someone is seeing as they walk along. Eventually, a man clad only in a pair of black swimming trunks emerges from the woods, skips up to the edge of a suburban swimming pool and dives in. Having swum a couple of lengths he is greeted at one end by the owner of the house holding out a drink and welcoming him to come and join his guests. The Swimmer is Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) and it soon becomes apparent that everyone at the house knows him and is happy to see him. He is charming and charismatic with the male guests and flirtatious with the females who obviously find him attractive. The other guests have not seen him for quite some time and when Ned is asked where he has been he evasively states \\\\\"here and there.\\\\\" When further questioned if he has had a good summer he replies \\\\\"sure, just great.\\\\\" The guests then begin to look puzzled when he gives answers to further questions that just don\\'t seem to make any sense. They exchange confused looks and clearly know something that we don\\'t. Ned, whilst looking out over the Connecticut valley begins to get an idea that he could swim in stages back to his house by using briefly the pools of several of his neighbours. he boldly announces that today he plans to \\\\\"swim across the county !\\\\\"As Ned visits each house and swims in each pool something more is revealed about his life and how he has behaved towards others in the past. Some people are pleased to see him, others are contemptuous of him and a few downright hate the sight of him.What becomes clear (SPOILER AHEAD) is that Ned has been away for a long time and re emerges into the life he once knew believing that it is about two years earlier than the present. He appears to have been a high flying Manhattan advertising executive who had the house, the car, the wife and the money but lost it all by living a life of pure selfishness. We are told that he married into the upper middle class and seems to have been given most of the success he enjoyed. At the various different pools he is revealed as a cheating husband, a bad father, a crook and a \\\\\"fair weather friend\\\\\". The result of his behaviour was that his wife either kicked him out or he was fired from his job or both.It is possible that Ned\\'s fall from grace brought about a nervous breakdown which has led to his memory loss and distorted view of reality. He may have even been hospitalised for the period that he is absent from the neighbourhood, but the absence is never explained. It is also unclear what became of his wife and daughters. They might simply have left him, but there are hints that they may actually be dead.The final scene where Ned eventually arrives \\\\\"home\\\\\" and his disillusionment is brought crashing back to reality is a great piece of symbolic storytelling.Most of \\\\\"The Swimmer\\\\\" was shot in 1966 and finally released in 1968. Maybe back then audiences weren\\'t ready to question the themes that are raised. Central to the story is the falseness of the American dream and how if you\\'re not \\\\\"somebody\\\\\" you\\'re not only a nobody, but you\\'re also not even welcome. The film \\\\\"American Beauty\\\\\" made in 1998 takes the same swipe at society and is a great film in its own right, but \\\\\"The Swimmer\\\\\" made thirty years earlier, is so much more effective at exposing the corrupt underbelly of the professional suburban existence.Burt Lancaster played many memorable roles and was certainly in much more enjoyable movies, but I think he does his finest acting in \\\\\"The Swimmer.\\\\\" He is perfect as the arrogant yet vulnerable and bemused Ned who cant work out whats going on. The movie does appear dated today and the musical score is very sixties, but any serious film fan should definitely see this at least once. It really is unforgettable.',\n",
       " \"This movie is not for everyone, but everyone I know who's seen it admits that it's one-of-a-kind.  Burt Lancaster is flat-out powerful in the lead, as the man who decides one day to swim his way through his neighbors' pools to his home.  As he makes his way pool by pool we learn more and more about Burt's real character.  A kaleidoscopic study of how we see ourselves, versus how others see us.  One of my favorites, please give this movie a shot.\",\n",

The Roger Vadim episode with the two Fondas is quite terrible, Jane with her left over costumes from Barbarella, is always watchable but what a mess. Delon and Bardot are fun to watch but the piece looks more a rehash of one of the weakest Hammer horror flicks than a film signed by the great Louis Malle.

Many didn\\'t see what hit them. In most other ways the film is by and large correct. The British were very reluctant to use Polish and Czech squadrons; despite many of these pilots being much more experienced than British.Oh and having read the other comments here - this does not follow just one squadron, Robert Shaw is one, Michael Caine another, The Czech/Poles others, Christopher Plummer another.

Henry Fonda surprises everyone by giving a strong performance as a bad guy. The close up of his eyes is stunning. The camera work and close ups have never been done better. The music is as good as anything you will find in a movie. Throw in the scenes when you first see Henry Fonda. The scene at the railway station which the water dripping on the hat. The sound of the spinning water tower. To me the closet movie to ART i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films.\",\n",

A very good film in fact. First-class direction, all pans and upshot angles, and slyly political, though its \\\\\"Cool Britannia\\\\\" ethos almost seems to parody devotees of the Union Jack. Anyone watching this film for reconfirmation of the Empire is mistaken, though the team\\'s final downfall notably comes from the only non-Caucasian member.The humour is self-conscious, but never so that it goes too far; it\\'s always witty. Michael Caine is the archetype Michael Caine, all pointing finger and raised-voice declarations, the version mimics love to portray. No\\\\u00ebl Coward is able support in a straightish role, though the wonderful Benny Hill parodies his own image, thus diluting his already fine (And misunderstood) ironic take on the sexual pervert.Screen realism is not an issue here, with a Mafia cameo who are hardly Don Corleone. Women are also marginalised, with only Maggie Blye getting a largish role as Caine\\'s girlfriend, Lorna. This is the same girlfriend who hires six women to help celebrate his release from prison, and refers to fellow womankind as \\\\\"birds\\\\\". Yet while the film is a \\\\\"boys only\\\\\" club, it\\'s far from a testosterone-led car chase, as Coward\\'s appearance should attest. And what makes the final climatic chase so rewarding is that it\\'s carefully, and intelligently, set up. The film is metaphorical where you wouldn\\'t expect it to be, and well-acted all round.All of which leaves me struggling for a way to end this review.

I can tell you that the title characters and many others in this fabulous movie were right on the money. There were very few \\\\\"normal\\\\\" folks who were regulars to Times Square at that time. Most visitors and tourists looked right through them but they were all there. Sexual perverts aka chickenhawks, Pimps, and of course the young kids coming off the buses from the heartland by the hundreds, ready to be savaged. The music, drug culture, attitudes of too many parents, and excitement of being a young, all combined to make people think they could \\\\\"make it\\\\\" in an area like TS. So very many never made it to adulthood because of the lifestyle: drugs, beatings and assaults were so common. Those who survived were damaged psychologically as well as physically.

       " 'If one rates a film on visuals alone, Fellini\\'s SATYRICON would surely be completely off the scale: a phantasmagorical mixture of sensual beauty and the distasteful but evocative grotesque set in an ancient Rome that never was, never could have been, and yet which plays up to every extreme concept we secretly harbor about Roman decadence. The leading men are incredibly beautiful; the women are generally seductively depraved; and the broad vision that Fellini offers is easily one of the visually stunning creations ever put to film.And yet, oddly, the film is sterile. The story is impossible to describe, a series of largely unrelated events in the lives of two impossibly handsome youths (Martin Potter and Hiram Keller) who begin the film by battling over the sexual favors of a slave boy (Max Born) who alternately unites and divides them until all three find themselves sold into slavery and flung from adventure to adventure, most often with sexual (and frequently homosexual) connotations. Clearly, Fellini is making a statement about the triviality and emptiness of a life lived for physical pleasures alone.But the film is jumpy, disjointed, disconnected; the sequences do not always arise from each other in any consistent way, leaving viewers with a sort of \\\\\"what the ...\\\\\" reaction when the film unexpectedly shifts without explanation. (This is actually in keeping with the original ancient text, of which only portions remain.) In consequence, SATYRICON is ultimately less about any philosophical statement Fellini may have had in mind than it is about sheer pictorial splendor and deliberate weirdness.Whatever its failings, it is an astonishing film, and one that would have tremendous influence on a host of directors who followed in Fellini\\'s wake--although all to often without his style and vision. Clearly Pasolini, director of such works as SALO, ARABIAN NIGHTS, and CANTERBURY TALES spent the better part of his largely unlamented life trying to out-Fellini Fellini; likewise, it is impossible to imagine how Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione arrived at the notorious CALIGULA without reference to Fellini\\'s SATYRICON.Such efforts to expand on SATYRICON were merely more explicit and less interesting than the original, and I do not really recommend them--nor do I really recommend SATYRICON for any one other than Fellini fans, for with its oddly disjointed feel it is unlikely to please those raised on mainstream. Still, it is a powerful, remarkably beautiful, and completely unexpected film that must be seen at least once by any one with a serious interest in world cinema, and to those I recommend it without hesitation.Gary F.

Well, they can\\'t fit all the money into the coffin so they take the body out in order to make room for their stash of cash.Craziness ensues as the two men try to hide both the money and the corpse from relatives and the police.

I thought the movie was very nicely tied together and I thought the reflections of Patton on the past was very necessary. Patton believed in reincarnation so in looking back at historical battles you can see how Patton developed his strategy. He was a student of great leaders and commanders and the movie developed that thought really well. The movie presented the characters, the actual war history, and the Germans extremely well and it is no wonder this movie received the awards it did. After watching this movie over and over again, I'm convinced that no one could have played Patton any better than George C. Scott. You can tell from the movie that he put everything he had into the character. My father-in-law was an officer under Patton in the 3rd. Army and has said over and again how realistic the movie is. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an excellent re-telling of WWII history.\",\n",
       " 'The war epic was revived with Franklin Schaffner\\'s admirable \\'Patton.\\' Schaffner\\'s control of his film is impressive, and the various campaign sequences are strikingly photographed through an audaciously wide lens...George C. Scott was commonly referred to as a \\'character actor\\' in view of his remarkably extensive range... Oddly for a character actor, Scott was almost always the same person on screen vigorous to the point of pugnacity, acting with his chin the way other actors do with their eyes-yet revealing, in his own eyes, unsuspected depths of humor and intelligence...Now few actors have ever been so convincing in such a powerful and colorful character... Only Peter 0\\'Toole\\'s eccentric T.E. Lawrence comes immediately to mind... Both, he and Scott, create their characters out of complementary contradictions... Lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it... Patton cannot separate the conduct of war from his own personal glorification, and both actors are given large canvases upon which to work...Screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and director Franklin J. Schaffner introduce a 16th-century warrior lost in contemporary times... He is a brilliant and military historian, with a hazardous speech...Magnificently uniformed, and wearing his ivory-handled pistol, George S. Patton steps up, against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, before an unseen gathering of soldiers defining himself in unambiguous terms as a man who revels in war... The scene is cut to a close shot of two scorpions crawling across the body of a dead soldier at the Kasserine Pass, Tunisia... The camera then pulls back to reveal a harsh look at American casualties with dozens of Arabs busily stripping more bodies...The American Army has just suffered its first defeat at the hands of the Germans... Patton\\'s first job is to restore the morale and discipline of the dispirited troops of his new command... His experience with tanks led General Dwight Eisenhower to place him in charge of one of the three task forces invading North Africa in 1943...According to his theory of war, Patton would drive all the way to Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily, slicing the island in half... But his finest moment comes during the massive German counteroffensive in the Ardennes... By the time the Germans feared him above all other Allied generals... Schaffner turns to the Germans for comments on Patton\\'s abilities... They expect him to lead a major invasion... When he was sent to Corsica, the Germans were convinced he would lead an invasion of southern France... When he was sent to Cairo, they feared for an invasion through the Balkans...Patton is seen reprimanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for indiscreet political statements... As an able tactician who promotes himself to three-star general before it\\'s officially approved by the U.S. Senate, Patton proves himself as the most effective American field commander of the European war... Behind his audacity lay an imaginative planning and a shrewd judgment... Patton knows that loyalty to a leader would inspire his men to take on objectives against all odds... His strict discipline, toughness, and disregard of classic military rules, contributed to his advance across France and Germany...The modest and conscientious Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. 12th Army Group, who had served under Patton in Africa and Sicily as a deputy commander, found Patton to be a superb combat general, but hotheaded, profane, and unpredictable... Bradley ends now as Patton\\'s superior... It was soon apparent that the two make a superb team... Patton\\'s dash and drive in the field is a perfect complement to Bradley\\'s careful planning...With the help of Bradley, Patton prepares to re-engage German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel... After he defeats Rommel\\'s 10th Panzer Division at El Guettar thanks to his analysis of Rommel\\'s published strategies, he shouts one of the greatest lines in war films: \\\\\"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\\\\\" At the same time, his rivalry with his Field Marshal Montgomery (hero of El Alamein) becomes more intense... Patton was motivated by a pride to reach his target before his British colleague, sometimes not for the purpose of the Allies...Karl Malden has the film\\'s only other significant leading role, as the most capable, yet unpretentious general... Malden could be deduced from the number of major directors with whom he has worked... These include Cukor, Hathaway, Kazan, King, Preminger, Milestone, Vidor, Hitchcock, Brooks, Mulligan, Daves, Brando, Frankenheimer, Ford, Quine and Schaffner... In his best and most personal work he has succeeded in exploring depths of moral ambiguity rare in commercial cinema...Schaffner illuminates various sides of Patton\\'s remarkable personality, presenting a dashing extrovert and attractive general, with a compassionate side...Touring an evacuation hospital in Sicily, Patton slaps an enlisted soldier twice calling him a \\'yellow,\\' and threatens to shoot him, before two men forcibly remove him from the tent... The incident occurs because Patton\\'s views of bravery and cowardice are so severely limited... The fighting general who has the imagination to write poetry and to believe that he has been reincarnated, in ancient Greece, at Carthage, and Moscow, cannot conceive of a psychological wound that he cannot see... The incident occurred after he prays at the bedside of one man severely injured... Patton whispers some words in his ear which the audience doesn\\'t hear, then lays a medal on his pillow and gives him a gentle touch on his head... The portrait is so compelling that it\\'s easy to overlook Patton\\'s own final words in the film, \\\\\"All glory is fleeting.\\\\\"Franklin J. Schaffner\\'s motion picture reveals an effective portrait of three men: Patton, Bradley, and the unseen Dwight Eisenhower... The film is a fine epic about \\'a pure warrior, and a magnificent anachronism,\\' who loved war...

Actually, all the details that mark every scientific thriller by Crichton are there in the film. The Andromeda Strain doesn't have any dinosaurs, it only has a small virus, but overall it is a much better film than any of the Jurassic Parks.

The book by Huxley is totally different, although the movie was faithful to most of the historical aspects of the story. The book is a beautiful testament of faith. You really should try to get a copy if the film piqued your interest in this slice of history. There is also an opera that is based on this story (as well as a John Whiting play) and all of this is based on historical facts. Obviously, I have done some research since seeing the movie.

Derek Jarman\\'s sets also lend a modern-retro kind of feel to the movie. Watch this one late at night when you are all alone. It\\'s a one of a kind that I have never seen duplicated since.

Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today. The younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control, junk culture is becoming commonplace, violence is desensitizing the masses, and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality.

In 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.Alex DeLarge is the leader of a band of \\'droogs\\' who move from location to location terrorizing their victims, putting them under outrageous acts of violence. When two of his \\'droogs\\' refuse to follow Alex\\'s path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them, until an act of reversal turns against Alex and he is brought down by the medical industry who decides to \\\\\"reform\\\\\" his heretofore sociopathic tendencies. One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness. Karma is a bitch.Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has a look and feel completely out of its time, closer to sometime in the future, and its torture sequence in which Alex is regenerated also looks straight out of a science fiction movie. However, this is not a science fiction film. It\\'s actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it\\'s something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted. It\\'s this approach that makes the work the product of a master of direction -- it can be seen multiple times and every time a different perspective arises, and all one can be left with is with the notion that this is pure, ultra-modern cinema.',\n",

He is being kept alive in a bizarre experiment to see just how long a torso can live in sensory deprivation. The doctors are convinced he has no real feeling, but he has dreams and memories and slowly pieces together what has happened to him. In his desperation he finds a way to communicate with a young nurse who cares for him and though she has been told he has no feeling; she finds otherwise, and tries to make the doctors aware. Johnny wants the world to know what has happened to him, what the war has done to him. Will they heed his plea or will they leave him in the living nightmare of isolation? This may be, on the surface, an anti war film, but underlying it all is a deep anti-establishment theme, for it is the politicians, the establishment who don't want to recognise this young man as a real person with feelings. He has no arms, you see, no eyes, no ears. His plight could not have been worse if he had dark skin or lacked external genitalia. He is a symbol of the ignorance of the establishment and though there is a possibility this story could be literally true, it is equally possible that Johnny could represent every single one of us, trapped in a place where we do not want to be, and no-one will listen...LLB\",\n",

The lack of special effects and gore make it all the more effective. Simple but amazingly good soundtrack. I saw this movie 30 years ago and it really haunted me. I found an import on DVD for which the quality is quite good. Many viewers see the movie as an enigma or riddle. Having seen it several times now I think the title says it all.

The theme is revolution.Parallels are drawn between Ireland and Mexico,two countries in violent uprising at the time.These parallels show that revolution is revolution,pretty much the same everywhere you go.It takes its casualties and destroys the lives of its survivors.James Coburn does his best performance ever in what I see as Leone\\'s attempt to toy with the image of his stereotypical hero like Man With No Name.Coburn\\'s Sean Mallory is Man With No Name caught in the grip of reality,as much as Steiger\\'s Juan Miranda is Tuco shown in the same light.All actors do a great job and Domingo Antoine is chillingly effective as the monstrous half-German colonel Ruiz,riding a tank which makes him synonymous with the Nazi Germany and SS,adding more menace to the overall demonic image.Romolo Valli is also great as the leftist doctor who is the brain behind the revolutionary force in a small town where Juan and Sean plan to strike,both from different reasons. His betrayal of his comrades is the greatest shock in the film.The flashbacks are among the most meaningful I have seen in a film and complement the story very well.As Mallory reaches into his difficult past,we first start to gain sympathy for him.The action scenes are overwhelming and exhaustive.The climax adds to the flow of strong emotions throughout the film as it is very dramatic.Steiger\\'s justified and merciless revenge on the evil colonel gives compensation for Mallory\\'s death and is maybe the most violent killing scene ever in western cinema,even beating \\\\\"Bonnie and Clyde\\\\\".Still,in the end,one cannot help but feel despair and pity as Juan is left on his own to ponder about it all and reflect on his own fate.Here Steiger really shows his greatness and is along with Coburn unjustly snubbed for a major award.All said,this film still has enough comedy,fun and light moments to bring you joy.I strongly recommend this picture to lovers of true western and fans of Coburn and Steiger.From here,Leone strayed into obscurity with his gangster epic \\\\\"Once Upon a Time in America\\\\\",making this his final swan song.10/10.',\n",
       " 'Watching Silent Running for the second time, many years later, I was amazed how different it was from my recollection. I remembered a story with a slight environmental message, cute robots that talked and a totally sympathetic lead character played slightly woodenly by Bruce Dern.Seen again, the green message ISN\\'T subtle, the robots DON\\'T talk, and far from wholly sympathetic, Dern plays a man suffering a complete nervous breakdown. Not only that, but it has an incongruous, jarring soundtrack by Joan Baez.So, it was a different film to how I\\'d remembered, but perhaps someway the better. Dern is far from wooden, and gives the performance of a lifetime. Even though this performance was overlooked for an Oscar nomination, it is still remarkable that the film was made at all. Can you imagine pitching this film to a Hollywood exec of the 90\\'s?\\\\\"There\\'s this guy who\\'s in his late thirties who looks after a forest in space.

       " 'This is probably one of the most offensive masterpieces ever made. There\\'s no reason to argue with many of the objections against it, but the main criticism- that Hoffman is battling his Amy\\'s rapists for sexual mastery of her- is unfair. Many of the film\\'s critics don\\'t seem to realize that what the audience learns about events is completely different from what Hoffman knows. He never learns that the villagers raped his wife; and he\\'s never completely sure that Nyles, the villager he\\'s defending, *didn\\'t* rape a girl. He never realizes that the villagers are hypocrites for raping his wife and then hunting down Nyles as a \\\\\"perverted animal.\\\\\" And he never realizes that his wife wants to throw Nyles out not because she\\'s an immoral coward, but because, after being raped once, she doesn\\'t want to defend an accused rapist. Amy is not the object of his fight, which is why he asks her if she wants to leave in the middle of it. She\\'s as irrelevant to him as the villager he\\'s defending. Hoffman\\'s only concern is his house, which Peckinpah views as the symbol of his manhood. They\\'re both under construction and assault by the villagers. When Hoffman has finally defended his house, he decides that he doesn\\'t really know his way home; his manhood is worthless to him. It\\'s difficult to understand why the film\\'s critics view its climax as an expression of Peckinpah\\'s supposed belief that women must be seized through violence.

On that level alone it is a terrific piece of film-making backed up with highly textured acting from the two principals. But there are layers and layers and layers in this film, and that is what makes it art, and a masterpiece. Peckinpah himself told people that Dustin Hoffman was the heavy, and the movie was a portrait of a bad marriage. Try watching with those two facts in mind, and the film takes on a whole new complexion. The Criterion Collection two-disc set of STRAW DOGS is excellent, from the Peckinpah documentary to interviews with Susan George and the producer, to the audio commentary track. I agree with other reviewers who stressed that Peckinpah wasn\\'t interested in \\\\\"solving\\\\\" problems; he wanted us to look at ourselves, and cringe.',\n",
       " \"Director Nicolas Roeg's ('Don't Look Now') cinematographic skills and admiration pay especial tribute to Walkabout's powerful combination of Australia's awesome scenic diversity and the sensual Jenny Agutter, and the whole effect is embellished by John Barry's sublimely magical score. I would hasten to add that as well as being very pleasing to watch, enhanced by Roeg's voyeuristic use of the camera, Agutter provides a skilful performance as a prejudiced unworldly teenager, who is naively unaware of the sexuality she exudes whether naked or wearing her high cut school skirt. Although it was a somewhat amusing shock to recently discover that a body double was employed for Agutter in the shower scenes for 'An American Werewolf in London', no such deceit was used in this film. Immediately after filming 'Walkabout', Agutter reprised her BBC serialisation role of two years earlier as Bobbie for Lionel Jeffries' sumptuous version of Edith Nesbit's 'The Railway Children', ensuring her immortalization as an iconographic beauty. She graduated thirty years on into the role of the mother for a Carlton TV production and is currently involved in producing a film script about the life of the author.On a deadly picnic into the desert a father (John Meillon; 'Crocodile Dundee') inexplicably snaps, shooting at his two children before torching his car and turning the gun on himself. Now the children, absurdly kitted out in their formal school uniforms, are lost and carelessly lose their provisions, except for the transistor radio with its inane babble being another illustration of how hopeless our technology is against nature. Fortuitously they stumble upon an oasis and find their only saviour in the form of an Aborigine (David Gulpilil; 'Rabbit Proof Fence') on a rites-of-passage walkabout. The seven year old boy (Lucien John, the director's son) happily has a child's ability to communicate with the Aborigine despite the language barrier, something his older sister never grasps, deftly demonstrated on their first encounter when she is increasingly frustrated by the lack of comprehension of her demands for water. Roeg crosscuts stunning kaleidoscopic images of the physical landscape and its critters, with the killing of animals and the domestic butchering of joints of meat to give a stark contrast between nature and civilisation. However, given this was his first solo effort, his overworked montages can be a little irritating and confusing, and show off the cinematographer rather than the director in Roeg.The director emphasises the unrealised sexual tension by explicitly marrying shots of both the teenagers with suggestive trees in the form of intertwined human limbs, as well as providing us with a diverting interlude involving a group of meteorologists. The deeply sad misunderstanding of the two cultures gives poignancy to the film that is its strength, especially delineated by the Aborigine's tribal courtship dance for Agutter, which only serves to terrify her and increase her distrust. Her lack of emotion for their former helpmate is staggering. When faced with a dangling corpse the girl asks trivial questions of her brother about his breakfast whilst pointlessly picking ants off the body. The tragic outcome is also indicative of the current state of Aboriginal life expectancy with a higher proportion dying through accident, assault and self-harm than any other Australian demographic group.The failure of her parents to prepare her for the change from childhood may have contributed to the tragedy, and it is only on reflection years later, living the same life as her parents and similarly caged in an apartment block, that Agutter's character senses that maybe she missed her chance. It is interesting to note that the children are deliberately English to highlight the cultural clash between the European settlers and the original inhabitants of this ancient land, and I wonder if similarly white Australians would have had any more understanding of the indigenous customs of the Aborigine boy. 'Walkabout' is a far more visual depiction of sexual awakening colliding with alien cultures than that other famous picnic that goes horribly wrong in Peter Weir's 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' (which this predates by four years), with its metaphorically implied unease centred on a sacred Aboriginal site that eventually destroys the established order of a Ladies College.'Walkabout' is as relevant today as when it was released in the era of '70's industrialisation with the Kakadu National Park once again under threat from a new uranium mine on its boundary. The Northern Territory's tribe Mirrar is currently involved in this dispute over land rights and excavations, although mining was temporarily ceased on Aboriginal land in the mid 1990's. This is a sensitive issue as Australia's economy relies on the export of uranium in the production of nuclear power, and Aborigines oppose the exploitation of the Earth's resources for profit. The company at the centre of this discord also operates the Ranger mine which is depicted along with the rock band Midnight Oil (well known for their campaigning land rights missive 'Beds Are Burning') in eX de Medici's 'Nothing's As Precious As A Hole In The Ground', a recent acquisition by Australia's National Portrait Gallery.Despite last year's rush by some of Hollywood's well-known directors returning home to make Aboriginal films, including Phillip Noyce's 'Rabbit Proof Fence' (released 21 February) about the 'Stolen Generation', and 'Yolngu Boy' which did well at a film festival in Colorado, I sadly suspect very few of us in the UK are likely to see them. Apparently there has not been a commercial success for a black-themed movie since 1955's 'Jedda', the first Australian feature to star Aboriginal actors. If the hope of a '70's New Wave style revival is to be realised for Australian cinema, surely it is time for the industry worldwide to wake up to the fact that a wealth of film exists outside of Hollywood, and that the viewing public may actually welcome some variety.With the release of the director's full cut in 1998 both the DVD and the video are unusually available for the UK as well as the US from Amazon.\",\n",

       " '\\\\\"Night of the Living Dead\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\\\" are two films that received a unanimous critical bashing when they were first released, but are now looked upon as ground-breaking horror masterpieces. That is also a classification that could be used to describe Wes Craven\\'s \\\\\"Last House on the Left\\\\\", but after 27 years, the film still hasn\\'t quite gotten the respect it deserves, and its greatness only seems to be recognized primarily among horror fans. While it is certainly not Craven\\'s most polished film, I still consider it to be his best, and indeed, Craven has acknowledged many times that he doesn\\'t even want to ATTEMPT to equal it. \\\\\"Last House\\\\\" was the first movie that aimed to show an audience what the REAL effects of violence were and the low-budget, documentary-like realism that Craven brought to the proceedings allows it to pack a bigger punch than a thousand professional studio films ever could. Yes, the movie has more than its fair share of flaws, but it is a measure of the film\\'s power that one can easily overlook them. The most flawed masterpiece of all time may be a strange way to describe a film, but that would be an accurate way to describe \\\\\"Last House on the Left\\\\\".As virtually everyone knows, the basic plotline is a reworking of Ingmar Bergman\\'s \\\\\"Virgin Spring\\\\\", but Craven does a superb job of translating the story\\'s details to a 1970s setting. Two teenage girls, Mari (Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) go into the big city for a rock concert, only to encounter three of the most memorable villiains in film history: Krug (David Hess), Weasel (Fred Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain), who are also accompanied by Krug\\'s heroin-addicted, guilt-ridden son, Junior (Marc Sheffler). The gang of escaped convicts kidnap the girls and proceed to rape and murder them, but when they seek shelter at the nearest house, they are stunned to find that their hosts just happen to be Mari\\'s parents - who unleash violent tendencies that they would have never thought possible once they discover that they are housing their daughter\\'s killers.The long, painful section of the film where the killers torture and murder the girls is where \\\\\"Last House on the Left\\\\\" impresses the most. Before these scenes, the villains have been presented as normal, funny, almost likable individuals, which makes their despicable actions all the more shocking. Craven shoots the scenes of degradation with the raw feel of a documentary, and while this is mostly due to his minuscule budget and lack of filmmaking experience, it lends an uncomfortable air of authenticity to the events. He also demonstrates his ability to toy with the audience\\'s emotions by intercutting the horror with slapstick scenes involving two inept cops who run into all sorts of misadventures while searching for Krug and his gang. While the idea of mixing the violence with humour is an effective one (and works well during some of his climactic scenes), the cop scenes are done in such broad, over-the-top fashion that they provide way too much of a contrast with the film\\'s disturbing moments. However, when the girls\\' death scenes do occur, they are protracted and extremely intense, and during the rape and murder of Mari, the killers actually give off expressions of shock and remorse for what they have done. Back in 1972, this approach to screen violence was unheard-of.The outstanding work of the unknown cast is what makes the film as effective as it is. Cassel and Grantham make extremely believable and sympathetic victims, though the real acting honours go to the villains. Hess (who also composed the film\\'s dated but often effective score) is truly remarkable in his role, making Krug into one of the most unforgettable screen psychopaths, and he is almost matched by veteran porn director Lincoln\\'s surprisingly effective turn as Weasel, presenting him as a humorous, laid-back character that is capable of shocking, cold-blooded violence. But while the film is often quite disturbing, it also has plenty of entertainment value. When the violence is not being displayed, the tone is very tongue-in-cheek, as Craven provides plenty of sharp dialogue and effective bits of black humour. In particular, the infamous scene where Weasel meets his painful revenge from Mari\\'s mother, and the dynamite dream sequence that precedes it, manage to be both shocking and oddly entertaining at the same time. But it is the film\\'s anti-violence statement that makes \\\\\"Last House\\\\\" so memorable, as Craven does not allow his characters to feel any satisfaction for their vicious actions. This is easily one of the ten most important horror films of all time, and a real personal favourite of mine. It demands to finally be recognized as the true groundbreaking achievement that it is.',\n",

From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for \\\\\"gangster movies\\\\\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather\\'s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every \\\\\"organized crime film\\\\\" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public\\'s imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \\\\\"influential\\\\\" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \\\\\"a movie about gangsters\\\\\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors\\' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone\\'s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don\\'s power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone\\'s ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito\\'s younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his \\\\\"innocence\\\\\" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos\\\\u00e9 of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra\\'s real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won\\'t go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn\\'t need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.',\n",
       " 'I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.',\n",
       " '\\\\\"The Godfather\\\\\" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I\\'ve ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I\\'ve ever seen or will ever see. It\\'s also one of the most precise and intricate films I\\'ve ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching \\\\\"The Godfather,\\\\\" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola\\'s direction is what brings this film, that\\'s so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He\\'s the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny\\'s (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito\\' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, \\\\\"That\\'s my family, Kay. That\\'s not me.\\\\\" We get the feeling that Michael\\'s nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino\\' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He\\'s the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family\\'s actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He\\'s treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader\\'s confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can\\'t refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino\\' shinning moment in the film. There\\'s no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get\\'s upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo\\'s height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, \\\\\"Fredo, don\\'t ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.\\\\\"That\\'s some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael\\'s change believable. He\\'s not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he\\'s capable of turning on anyone and using the line, \\\\\"It\\'s strictly business\\\\\" when it comes to family issues. Michael\\'s sister, Connie, calls him a \\\\\"cold hearted bastard\\\\\" at the end of the film. It\\'s hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino\\' performance is that he doesn\\'t sugarcoat it. He doesn\\'t try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That\\'s the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let\\'s us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like \\\\\"The Godfather,\\\\\" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.',\n",
       " \"The movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style. It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good.The story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal.It's unnecessarily violent and why did Brando put paper towel in his mouth?

       " \"A 9.1 on IMDb? cat-scans please .I've never seen a worse depiction of Italians in my life. More like caricatures and stereotyping Italians from the turn of the century as smug talking idiots with Im gonna bust you upside yer f** head as the main dialog - every one is depicted as a ghetto talking grease monkey. Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero.\",\n",
       " 'Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to \\\\\"Goodfella\\'s\\\\\" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike \\\\\"Apocalypse Now\\\\\", \\\\\"The Godfather\\\\\" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the \\\\\"Gladiator\\\\\" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies. \\\\\"The Godfather\\\\\" is the cinematic equivalent of Baroque architecture, excessive, gaudy and not worth the work to create.',\n",

The film is a tragicomic gem. Bette Davis speaks a few words in English and the very few words in Italian she utters where dubbed but, I swear to you I thought it was her. The work of the dubber is astonishing. Totally seamless. I hear she didn\\'t get along with Alberto Sordi, what a surprise. She referred to him as \\\\\"Mr. Sordid\\\\\". But beyond those little trivia things, let me tell you, it\\'s a wonderful film. Alberto Sordi, one of the greatest but practically unknown in the States, gives a sensational performance.

       " 'Cries and Whispers is a powerful study of three sisters and a faithful maid who share a manse in a remote location. One of the sisters, the sympathetic and essentially good-hearted Agnes (Harriet Andersson in a gut-wrenching performance), is dying from an indeterminate cancer, and it is her slow journey towards death, its effect on her sisters and Anna the maid, and its aftermath that is the center of this story. Though why she, and not her sisters, should be afflicted, neither the movie nor Bergman can explain, and rings out as an injustice.The reason if, the other two sisters are variations of monstrous people who are successful: Karin (Ingrid Thulin) is what seems to be an icy control freak, not a horrible woman, but close, who cannot stand human touch of any kind, and we\\'re privy to her torment in a flashback where she uses a piece of a broken wine glass to literally mutilate her vagina, seemingly enjoying it (as she shocks her husband), while writhing in unspeakable pain. Maria (Liv Ullmann) shows less, is more of an enigma and a hard character to pinpoint, but she\\'s equally manipulative if not flatly repulsive: she not only tries to resume an affair with Agnes\\' doctor (who points out she her internal ugliness is starting to show through her facial expressions as she apparently enjoys this criticism) but she also fails to help her husband at a critical moment when he stabs himself in the stomach. Later on, both sisters (particularly Karin) verbally express their hatred for each other in a powerful montage that leads to a moment of equally intense reconciliation that comes without the use of dialogue and is emphasized by the swell of music (Chopin). Ingrid Thulin stands out, letting the gamut of Karin\\'s sheer rage our out of her visage while suddenly changing back to a softer self, then to her steely image of self-control and back to fury in a snap of fingers.There\\'s a lingering question throughout the movie: there must have been some extreme trauma, some truly horrific event (or events), that must have set forth the deluge of pain that rips throughout the entire story right up until the end. Karin herself alludes to the \\\\\"tissue of lies\\\\\" that could mean anything: possible sexual abuse by the unseen father, a complicity between Maria and her mother, and Agnes in the center, rejected. Although Karin does mention the revulsion she felt towards Maria, one can only wonder what it was that transpired which seems to have driven her into momentary lapses of insanity. In fact, her self-hatred mirrors Agnes\\' intense suffering rather closely, although both characters rarely interact and are on entirely different planes. In some ways, it wouldn\\'t be out of place to say that Agnes, despite the unimaginable suffering she endures, serves as merely a catalyst, a materialization of the horror Karin herself has had to face. At least Agnes has experienced a form of love, if selfless, under the guise of Anna who comes to her aid, gives of her breast in an almost saint-like passion. Karin only has the cold future of her own dismal life to face. And Maria isn\\'t even alive, but sadistically observing.Aside from PERSONA this has to be one of Ingmar Bergman\\'s most powerful works, one that hits an audience at a gut level (cliched as though it may sound). The dominant color red only adds tension to the already tense scenes between the quartet of women (and the men, who only make pat but indelible appearances). Woody Allen would use these stylizations of the face looking dead at the camera, telling a story of its own in INTERIORS, another looks at three sisters, neither of them sympathetic. Grueling, sometimes unwatchable, this is movie watching at its best.',\n",

Yesterday I saw the film again in its original English version. My goodness, what a difference! The film is even more frightening that I remembered. The atmosphere is asphyxiating. You can actually smell the rotting stench of the most beautiful city in the world. The ending leaves you breathless and the acting, well, listening to the actors real voices is another experience altogether. The pain and sudden burst of hope in Julie Christie is moving, very moving and very unsettling. Sutherland, as usual, is magnificent.

       " 'It is generally accepted that a political meaning has to be decoded whenever looking at this movie (it was filmed in the last years of Franco\\'s dictatorship in Spain, and the story takes place in 1940, a year after the Spanish Civil War ended). But I suggest that one should firstly pay attention to the closest level of meaning: that is, just looking at the plain story narrated, metaphors aside. As 30 years after it was filmed so many people all over the world finds the movie fascinating it must be because of its emotive story about childhood universe, narrated in a poetically quiet tone.The life of Ana, a five year-old girl living in a little village of Castille, is subverted after watching James Whale\\'s \\\\\"Frankenstein\\\\\" in a mobile cinema (the scene in itself is a cherished sample on the sociology of movie-going). The non appropriate for children movie raises questions in Ana, who is fascinated by the mystery of the Monster -or Spirit- as her older sister tells her that he lives close to their large house. For Ana, the heart of this mystery is the discovery of death amidst the lies of her sister and the oppressing family environment, dominated by the effects of war. Ana will be devoted to looking for the Spirit-Monster and when she finds a wounded fugitive soldier (a superb scene without words) she will feed and clothe him as she takes him for the Spirit; later on she will be shocked by the discovery of death. The mixture of reality and fantasy in a child\\'s mind when dealing with the mysteries of life and death in the context of an alienated family and the devastated landscape of the postwar period in Spain, is the main story narrated from Ana\\'s point of view.There are other stories which can be interpreted in several ways: the enigmatic life of the father, devoted to writing about social organization of bees; the mother writing to a distant beloved one; the sister, who deceives Ana with stories and playing death. These other plots convey other meanings to the movie; in a second level of meaning it is possible to interpret the beehive and the large house as a metaphor for the isolated Spain after the war, the monster as the incarnation of totalitarianism (made up of death bodies and the mind of a criminal), the two sisters as the metaphor of the two bands that fought in the fratricide Spanish War, and even the encounter of Ana with the fugitive soldier could be interpreted as the impossibility for this two bands of the country for becoming reconciled. There was a political intention for the movie, but is the plain story of the discoveries in childhood what gives the film a lasting preeminence. It also stands out for the great cinematography and the acting of children.',\n",
       " \"The European arthouse movie, since the 50s at least, has been generally seen in opposition to Hollywood.  Instead of relying on cartoonish genre, broad comedy and loud, violent action, it supposedly offers analysis, detail, character, critique, context, civilised intelligence.  Crudely put, Hollywood appeals to the senses, European films to the mind. \\\\nLA GRANDE BOUFFE is an almost archetypally European movie - a Franco-Italian co-production, directed by a noted auteur, Marco Ferreri, and starring arguably the three greatest of all European actors, Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli and Phillipe Noiret.  It features allusions to philosophy, art history and literature, and is confined, Bunuel-like, to the single set of a decaying town mansion.  It is also about four middle-aged men stuffing themselves to death, blocking toilets until they messily explode, and, er, breaking wind.Ferreri treats his theme of excess - food, sex, self-pity - with an almost Oriental restraint, matching lengthy, static long shots so dense with detail and so darkly lit that it's often difficult to make anything out, to extreme close-ups, pitilessly exposing yet also strangely moving: a bit like Ozu filming Fellini.  It's hard to know how to recommend this film - and I do, very strongly. Four professionals - a cook, a pilot, a TV producer and a judge - convene at the latter's unused mansion to spend a weekend non-stop eating a prodigiously elaborate feast made from the choicest meats: many prospective meals are walking about in the garden.We gradually learn that they have come here to die, but Marcello is unable to continue without sex, so they hire some prostitutes, as well as inviting a local, seemingly innocent, teacher, who is soon revealed to have appetites equal to any of the men.  And so the men eat.  And eat.  And eat.  They sometimes have sex, watch antique 'erotic' slides, drive cars, get sick. But mostly they eat.  They even have competitions to see who can eat the fastest.This, ironically, does not sound very appetising for the viewer.  There is no narrative drive for instance - any conflict possibly brought by the pure, innocent Andrea, a symbol of life in an atmosphere of decay, to whom Phillipe proposes marriage, are quickly dashed by her own taste for depravity.  The men decide to die, and we watch them do it.  The film begins with a methodical introduction to all four characters, and ends as methodically picking each one off.So what is the film about?  Is it an allegory - a group of fairly representative French bourgeois gathered in a knackered mansion with a sparse, dying garden, might suggest so.  But an allegory of what?  The decline of French masculinity, patriarchy, capitalism?  The judge and TV producer especially are examples of the most powerful, potentially corrupting forces in Western society, the law and the media.  The women all escape and survive, although the closing shot of Andrea returning to the home is highly ambiguous.BOUFFE is very Bunuellian, from the EXTERMINATING ANGEL-like idea of bourgeoisie trapped in a mansion (figured in the inability of Marcello to leave in his sportscar, doomed to drive up and down the avenue), to the profusion of animals, observing the men's descent into bestiality, as they grunt and hoot and growl, and become fatal slaves to their appetites.  Is it a study in decadence - there are many shots framed like grotesque parodies of Renaissance paintings; that optimistic project is flatulently shot here. There are allusions made to both Boileau - the father of French neo-classicism - and Brillat-Savarin, whose Physiognomy of Taste is a famous combination of philosophy and gastronomy which the four men take to nihilistic limits.  Is it a death knell of film, as the parody of Don Corleone suggests, as four old men watch slides like a corruption of early cinema?I don't know.  But for me the pleasures were many.  The home itself, stuffed with so much bric-a-brac you can barely make out the characters.  The fragmentary motifs returning in the coolly formal style - the replaying of certain scenes and shots; the repetition of the inchoate, beautiful, yearning tango music, which is connected to one character but shifts as he becomes a ghost.  The museum of the dead culminating in the extraordinary, triangular shot of the sprawled Ugo, with Marcello and Michel behind him. The limitless, ingenious, grotesque variations on sex and food.  The gross comedy.  The genius compositions.  The colours.  The sight of three actors who have starred in some of the 20th century's supreme artistic achievements running from faecal rivers, and putting the rump back into rumpo.\",\n",

       " 'Good film about the making the of a movie, all the things that can happen during the production, including affairs with actors and crew members, representation of older actors who are depressed because their careers are not the same like when they were younger, and the opposite, the representation of older actors who are doing good with their carrers as they getting older, maybe because of luck or maybe just because they were able to handle this life better than others, and also the death of a actor during the filmmaking and how this affect the film.Also the film shows a lot of the smallest stories that occurred in a set, like when you watch a interview or a documentary about the making of a film, a lot actors are going to say the type of things that are portrayed here in this film, also a big part of this movie is like a documentary, especially the first two acts.Even with all that said, the most negative point is that in the first hour of the film the characters are not very interesting, which makes that part of the movie kinda boring, but in the third act the film gets more focused on the characters and makes the ending more exciting to watch.',\n",

       " 'I was just watching a GoodBadFlicks video yesterday where the guy was laughing at US movie studios for buying film rights for some stories and foreign films that they could never ever present in the US for fear of protests. For me it was a strange proposal, why wouldn\\'t they be able to show something raw, uncensored, original? The answer was obvious, but I am not going to dwell on that point.La Planete Sauvage is probably a movie in this category. The film is short, just over an hour, but from the very beginning it starts with something controversial: a woman carrying a baby is being teased by giant humanoids that have fingers the size of the woman. It turns out they are children, playing with the human as a human would play with an ant. They accidentally kill her and her baby is being taken as a pet by one of these giants. They are called Tragg and they consider humans animals, to be petted or exterminated as they please. The very first scenes are brutal to watch and that\\'s why I think this would never sit well with a culture that values superiority more than anything else.You have to watch it in French, if you get the language, I had a dual French/English audio film with English subtitles and, even if I didn\\'t go through the English audio, there is something about the French language that just naturally blends with the arrogant culture of the Traggs. The Tragg culture and their planet were truly spectacular. To think that in 1973 someone thought of a superior technological culture that is truly alien while remaining humanoid, and did it well, was amazing. The concepts hold true even now, in 2014!I have to say that I have been thinking of writing a story about humans treated as pets by an alien culture, but after I\\'ve seen this I couldn\\'t possibly do it, as it is perfect as storyline and concepts. It also makes me think of another subject close to my heart: dogs. In Romania there are still a lot of vagabond dogs and the heartless and pointless discussions about exterminating them are very close to what the Tragg are doing when considering the human vermin. There are also some ideas about the \\\\\"wild human\\\\\" society that hit close to this concept of groups of people gathering around the mentality of the lowest common denominator. So, in my mind, to add valid philosophical and moral points to an already brilliant story with fantastic drawings is like covering the icing of the cake with a ton of cherries!About the animation style. This is something that made some people rate this film a lot lower than it deserves. Are you aware that it was made in 1973, by Czech animators? Actually, besides the voice actors and the wonderful director Ren\\\\u00e9 Laloux, there were almost no French people in the production team. The animation in the Czech Republic is a reason for national pride, but the way they do it was unique and certainly different from the US, French and Japanese animation styles. OK, so maybe you prefer the animation style of Robin Hood, with the animals, but really, this is so much better in so many ways that I couldn\\'t possibly get snagged on animation.Bottom line: The imagination, the way it just threw out there idea after idea, no matter how uncomfortable, the storyline, the amazing creatures, the weird ways in which they were killing people... it was true sci-fi. The real thing! Watch this! It will take an hour of your life, big deal! You will see that your brain will churn all of those ideas for a while after watching the film. It will feel like a strange but amazing flavor on your tongue. Top rating!',\n",

Eager to escape the oppressive walls of his dark life, Paul embarks on a very complete sexual experience with a willing young woman in which there is no history spoken, no promises of future liaisons, no ties of any kind with the outside... The two lovers know nothing of each other, not even their names... Their affair is purely physical, and the barren apartment becomes, as Bertolucci intended, a world of debauchery on which is explored a catalog of behavior that seems more childish than kinky...Jeanne is a child-woman... She asks what she should call Paul, and they proceed to give themselves names brought only out of grunts, growls and screeches... Paul's cruelty is not justified and perhaps this is what attracts the modish girl... Some scenes emotionally are so provocative that you experience a wide range of feelings... Paul never asks Jeanne a direct question, but is constantly framing her for his next experiment, besides he assaults her, humiliates her and pushes her over the edge... There is one great moment for the heroine when she refuses Paul's power play and is equally unimpressed by his new declarations of love... She insists: 'It's over!' The film is beautifully shot... The cinematography is unique, somber, shadowy and painterly... It presents despair, and the music reinforce the despairing mood... The movie is also intensely erotic, intensely realistic, immensely disturbing... The extreme frankness makes faintly uncomfortable viewing, not only because of its sexual material but because of its exploration of our inner nature with true perspective... Hopefully, younger viewers can turn their minds back to a time when sex was mysterious and beautiful; dangerous and daring; not just easy and transitory... Sex nearly always implies intimacy, but doesn't always provide it... 'Last Tango in Paris' is one of the great explorations of cinema's visual possibilities\\\\u0085 Bertolucci camera's movements throughout the film characterize the rights steps of the tango which the two main characters execute at the climax of the film...

We see how traditional survival methods and intrinsic common sense can help the more urbanised army men to cope with the extremes of climate and geography. Eventually the nomad is persuaded to join the general on his trip back to a town. His ignorance of urban life is apparent, but interesting nevertheless, as we do not imagine such people nor meet them in everyday life today. Kurosawa is on top form here, letting the camera take in the vastness of Siberia, and still allowing the viewers to observe the characters closely. The story is interesting too, with a sadly ironic ending (won't say any more!). I think everybody should watch this film, because everybody will have something to learn from it.\",\n",
       " \"After the box office failure of Dodes'ka-Den, Kurosawa was extremely depressed and attempted to commit suicide. After his recovery, he got over his depressive state and directed the Japanese/Russian co-production, Dersu Uzala.Set in the forests of Siberia in the 19th century, Dersu Uzala is one of the most important films about friendship ever made. It tells the story of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomine) as he leads an expedition through the woods. While his group is camping one night, a small mountain man named Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk) comes across the men and agrees to act as their guide. The friendship between Dersu and Vladimir grows over the years and Vladimir urges Dersu to return to the city with him but the latter always refuses. Finally Dersu agrees to go, but finds that it is a very difficult adjustment to make.This was the first Kurosawa film that I ever saw and it amazed me in so many ways. The beautiful landscapes, the well-developed characters, and most importantly, the great friendship between Dersu and Vladimir make this one of my favorite films.\",\n",
       " \"Chinatown is a tremendous collaborative effort that produced one of the most memorable Hollywood pictures of the 1970's. Director Roman Polanski (his last film in America, and the first he made in America after the murder of Sharon Tate), stars Jack Nicholson &amp; Faye Dunaway, and writer Robert Towne, all come together to create a detective story classic. At times it slows its pace down so the viewer can think along with Nicholson's character, to take in the environment as well as the situation he's in (i.e. when he goes to the empty reservoir, when he visits Noah Crosses house the first time). And the script has the perfect sense of drawing us into a story, fueled by curiosity, grit, and cynicism, and engages the viewer by its realistic dialog between the characters.J.J. Gittes (Nicholson, in one of his best 70's performances) is in Los Angeles circa 1933 in the line of private investigator, usually dealing with people who may or may not believe that their significant other is having an affair. Evelyn Mulwray feels this may be the case with her husband Hollis, and Gittes decides to take the case. However, this draws him into a deeper case involving the city's loss of water once Hollis- a major player in the water supply controversy in the city- is found murdered. This eventually leads him to Noah Cross (John Huston), a big businessman and who also happens to be Evelyn's father. Intrigue starts to develop, as Jake's own life begins to be at risk.As a intricate, detailed detective story the film is an above-average work, with Towne's script containing the maturity, and wicked sense of humor, of a James M. Cain or Raymond Chandler novel. When the thrills come they come as being striking. And when humanity and compassion get thrown into the mix, the film reaches a whole other plane of intelligence. The last third of the film could turn off some of the audience (depending on one's own level of belief), but it holds strong thanks to the performances. Nicholson doesn't over-step his bounds in any scene, finding the right notes in suggestive conversations. Dunaway is better than expected (though I'm not sure if it's an great performance). And Huston's Noah Cross is one of the more disturbing villains of that period in movies. Add to it some good cameos (Burt Young as a driver, Polanski playing the little guy in the infamous 'knife' scene), and a smooth soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, Chinatown comes out as strong piece of movie-making, and arguably one of the greatest in the crime/mystery genre.\",\n",

In addition to Matthau and Shaw, the supporting cast (Hector Elizondo, Martin Balsam, Jerry Stiller, Tony Roberts, and so forth) is are just as excellent as the two unflappable leads.

I think what is still with me after this is the sense of fear and utter WEIRDNESS that emanates from the movie...And it all seemed so realistic...no hokey fountains of blood, no running into the shower, or overused cliches, just a bunch of kids that need to get some gas, meet some very odd characters (The Hitchhiker is superb) and then fall into the wrong place at the wrong time...I think Hooper must have had some divine inspiration, because each of Leatherface's scenes is exquisitely planned and executed, from the first guy who gets dragged down, to Pam, to the encounter with Franklin and Sally in the woods (how chilling and scary was that, and yet how clever, to chase someone in the woods equipped with...a chainsaw) to the end.Very, very unsettling as well, from the beginning to the final dinner scene, to the unforgettable whirling dance by Leatherface at the end.Simply put, the best horror movie ever...if this doesn't scare you, then nothing will, sadly.\",\n",
       " 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this movie is a legend in the horror genre. I have heard so much about this movie, the interesting thing is, my mom told me it\\'s one of the bloodiest movies she\\'s ever seen, then she paused and said \\\\\"Wait, actually there wasn\\'t that much blood\\\\u0085 it\\'s just creepy\\\\\". So I had to see this movie, was it really that scary? Is it really that bloody? Is it really that creepy? I had to see for myself, so of course I bought the movie, it was on sale, watched it during the day, not much effect, was pretty disappointed. But then my friends came over and we wanted to watch a scary movie and they all saw that I had The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, we turned off the lights, turned on the surround sound and then the screams came as I realized this is one messed up movie! Sally Hardesty and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin travel with three friends to a cemetery where the Hardestys\\' grandfather is buried to investigate reports of vandalism and corpse defilement. Afterward, they decide to visit an old Hardesty family homestead, and on the way, the group picks up a hitchhiker. The man speaks and acts bizarrely, and then slashes himself and Franklin with a straight razor before being forced from the group\\'s van. Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming hole, and the couple heads off to find it. Instead, they stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk decides to ask the residents for some gas, while Pam waits on the front steps. Receiving no answer but finding the door unlocked, Kirk enters the house and is immediately murdered by Leatherface. Pam enters soon after to find the house filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee but is caught by Leatherface and impaled on a meat hook. At sunset, Sally\\'s boyfriend Jerry heads out to look for the others. Finding the couple\\'s blanket outside the neighboring house, he investigates and finds Pam still alive inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface appears and kills him, stuffing Pam back inside the freezer afterward. With darkness setting, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the killer\\'s house, calling for the others, Leatherface lunges out of the darkness and murders Franklin with a chainsaw. She is captured and invited to Leatherface\\'s house for a family dinner she\\'ll never forget.Movies from the 1970\\'s are so special to me, the reason why I think some of the greatest horror movies came out of that decade is due to the fact that directors didn\\'t hold back like today. Most directors of today\\'s Hollywood are too scared of the censors or go too far and make the audience gag rather than scream. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre I\\'m sure Tobe Hooper wasn\\'t exactly expecting this movie to become the classic it has. Leatherface is frightening and I\\'m not so sure I\\'d accept an invitation from him and his family for dinner. I think they made the Manson family look like the Cleavers, you haven\\'t seen a horror film until you\\'ve seen The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.10/10',\n",

Even the audience begin to feel the effects of Stockholm Syndrome as Pacino's character gains our affections. The 'villain who's a nice guy at heart' could have been disastrously clich\\\\u00e9 but Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of brilliance. Even Sal with his morbid disposition is magnetising as his childlike innocence shines through. Calzale was wonderfully cast as this awkward accomplice, wordlessly following Sonny.

       " \"Occasionally during the 1950's and 1960's I and friends interested in literature and the arts would discuss a book,  written anonymously in 1954 by a woman author using the name Pauline Reage, and commonly regarded as a very powerful work depicting submission as the route to a woman's fulfillment. This discussion was however largely based on hearsay - the book itself was not readily available in the U.K. where I was then living. We understood that a copy was available in the British Museum reading room for anyone who called themselves a scholar, but it was not regarded as suitable reading matter for ordinary folk, and no British publisher dared to publish it.  When I eventually saw it on sale I was sufficiently intrigued to purchase a copy, and I quickly appreciated that the very deadpan and unemotional style of writing gave this work an extraordinary power which made it difficult to forget. Unlike most books, it was very hard to understand the author's motive in writing it, but the scenes of pain and humiliation it featured were so lucid that I assumed it would never be possible for this book to be filmed.  I was therefore quite surprised when Just Jaeckin's film was released in France in 1975. Many years passed before this film was cleared by British censors for distribution in the U.K., and by then I was living in North America where I have seen it both in the cinema and on the First Choice television channel. The film features almost everything described in the book with remarkable accuracy, but it is depicted in such an unemotional and almost documentary manner that it is remarkably non-pornographic. SPOILER AHEAD.  Right through history the wish to own and dominate women has been part of the masculine character, and this is brought out clearly in the literature of every age. However literature has not always made it equally clear that there is just as frequent a wish on the part of many women to be totally submissive. Such a woman often believes that however unreasonable the demands made on her by her dominant man, this behaviour will ultimately force him to truly love her. Artistically it is important to note that nothing which happens to 'O' in this film takes place before she is asked for, and has given, her consent. Voluntary, but total and completely passive submission is the theme of the film. There is one scene in the film which I found particularly  effective. This is the Commander's ball just before the end which 'O' attends, naked except for a fabulous mask that makes her appear completely anonymous. Sir Stephen gives 'O' the chance to choose the mask she will wear, and she chooses one which is strongly suggestive of a bird of prey. The symbolism of this appears to be that, by their very submissiveness, these women are also preying on their men who become deprived of any opportunity to form any normal relationship with them; and may thereby be psychologically damaged almost as badly as their victims.  \\\\n\\\\tOnly right at the end of the film does any emotion break through, when Sir Stephen indicates to 'O' that her prolonged submission to pain and humiliation have won his love, and she responds by demonstrating the affection she feels for him for the first time. When this film was first shown in Paris it ran for thirteen years and I found it intriguing to read that more than half of most audiences were women. Clearly, even in these days of active feminism, the concept of attaining true love through a role of total submission has some appeal to a large number of women. This is the reality which has to be borne in mind by the viewer whenever watching this or any similar film. \\\\tThis is a film which many will watch for its curiosity value, but which will probably only appeals to a very small number. Within its limitations it is extremely well made, and it is certainly not pornographic. Although there is plenty of nudity there are no shots showing either male or female genitals, and no attempt is made to dwell on any of the violence just for titillation. Overall it probably deserves a reasonably high rating, unfortunately I cannot give it this. I am amazed at how accurately the scenes depicted in the film follow the written descriptions in the novel - it is obvious that its makers took a great deal of trouble to ensure this. My basic concern is that this disguises the fact the film completely reverses the message which the original novel appears to have been intended to convey. There were two different endings to the book which are still extant. Both involve Sir Stephen losing all interest in 'O' after he has completed humiliating her in every way he can. In one 'O' begs Sir Stephen to permit her to commit suicide - she would not do it without his explicit permission, but he grants her this. In the other she is returned to the training mansion to help teach her replacement what will be expected. Either of these endings convey the clear message that total submission does not lead to greater love but ultimately to contempt for the oversubmissive individual. Because it reverses this message; the film, however closely it may follow the book in other respects, is totally unacceptable to me.\",\n",

OK so there's this shark and it's huge and it's terrorizing a beach community in New York. Great, so that should be scary except we never really see the shark (I know people will say that's what is scary is that we don't even see it especially for the first attack and that's supposed to somehow make it more terrifying, but the truth is they just couldn't get the shark to work so they shot around it, and I found it to be about a zero out of ten on the scary scale), and then when we do finally see the shark it's a total joke! It looks so incredibly fake and moves around almost not at all and looks very awkward and unreal. The only part that was cool at all was the captain fighting the shark to the bitter end. Richard Dreyfuss hiding at the bottom of the ocean from the shark was also stupid, just so they could avoid the sadness of seeing him die? Dumb.

       " 'This unflinching, hard-hitting look at slavery is a severely underrated and misjudged film. That\\'s probably because it sheds light onto a tough, painful subject that many people would prefer to ignore or forget; if you\\'re expecting a \\\\\"slaves-and-masters-are-all-a-big-happy-family\\\\\" depiction of the life in the mid-19th-century Southern plantations, then this simply isn\\'t your movie.\\\\\"Mandingo\\\\\" was followed, one year later, by \\\\\"Drum\\\\\".

       " 'Truly, truly brilliant.  It is so rare that I see a film that I wouldn\\'t change, and I honestly can\\'t think of a thing.  Huston\\'s films so often include that quintessential scene -- the one where his characters realize that they\\'ve lost everything, and respond with unbridled true character. Those who cry or bemoan the loss are beyond redemption.  But those who can laugh in the face of disaster, who can ask forgiveness for the patently unforgivable -- they are the greatest of Huston\\'s figures, and perhaps the greatest characters of cinema.  Just as Bogart and Hepburn laugh while they lie in the bottom of a boat awaiting death, Michael Caine and Sean Connery face certain death in this film and respond with complete honesty and complete honor.  For all of their lies and arrogant ambitions, they are still a pair of b*****ds you would love to know.Which brings me to the two incredible performances.  It is nearly impossible for such recognizable actors to fade into the guise of their characters. But Caine and Connery manage it, and with perfect aplomb.  As best friends, they are perfectly inseparable, and their innate connection makes for one of the most affecting male friendships in history.  Surrounded, with no reasonable hope in the world, Danny asks Peachy to forgive him for being \\\\\"so bleeding high and so bloody mighty.\\\\\" And, of course, Peachy forgives him. These are men who sing boldly in the last moments of life.  God bless John Huston.',\n",
       " 'The greatest \\\\\"buddy film\\\\\" of all time. What makes this so? First off, casting two real life friends, Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Second, all other \\\\\"buddy films\\\\\" are simply comedies. And while the Man Who Would Be King has some laughs in it, and Connery and Caine bounce off of each other almost as good as Abbott and Costello, the story itself is a drama. And what a drama it is. Two English soldiers set out to be the rulers of a country, but can anyone who was a grunt one day, and a king the next, become a King without getting an inflated ego? The answer is no and that becomes the ultimate test for these two friends. Terrific performances by Caine, Connery and even Christopher Plummer, who gives a brief, but good performance as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the short story this film was based on. This film features perhaps the greatest ending to a movie ever made. You will never forget it, and you will wish that you had a friendship as strong as these two individuals.',\n",

Tough to say, but the marriage between both director and actor are quite phenomenal. From the first time we see Jack Nicholson to the sad, yet uplifting ending, one cannot escape the sheer power of the film.

Some of these guys include Danny DeVito (in his first role), Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif (in his Oscar nominated role) and the never forgettable Will Sampson who played the Chief.

Giving the Oscar to Louise Fletcher for her performance has to be the all-time joke of the movie business. That much more able actresses had turned the role down speaks for itself. With the current lack of financial wisdom in the US in 2008, however, the film obviously had some serious irony up its sleeve to be kept for 33 years down the track. Fortunately since 1975, most Award seasons have seen logic and reason return to The Academy. One can only conclude that most of the Academy members who voted this Lulu Best Picture must have been smoking the butts that Ken Kesey couldn't finish.\",\n",

If you had read the book you would understand my reasoning. The movie is one of the worst portrayals of a book that I have ever seen. They left so many details out of the movie that were in the book. Two Thumbs down, hopefully this crap will again be remade into something way better than what this is. This should not have been nominated for best picture (1975), and should not have won.

       " 'With Pier Paolo Pasolini\\'s \\\\\"Salo,\\\\\" the long-disputed issue of the extent to which a filmmaker can interpret a story on screen has been put to the ultimate test.And when \\\\\"extreme\\\\\" cases do happen, do the censors become \\\\\"morally\\\\\" justified in interfering with the filmmaker\\'s \\\\\"creative freedom\\\\\"?There are a good number of films that can be used to illustrate the issues raised:Alejandro Jodorowsky\\'s \\\\\"Santa Sangre\\\\\" can be a case in point regarding the subject of violence and gore (a mentally-disturbed serial murderer and his domineering mother, with surreal images and subtle attacks on the Catholic faith),while Nagisa Oshima\\'s \\\\\"In the Realm of the Senses\\\\\" can be a point of reference regarding the subject of sex and nudity (a couple---a geisha and a tradesman---who has practically made sexual intercourse the be-all and end-all of their lives, to the point of obsession and possessiveness).On the other hand, Pasolini\\'s film shows both \\\\\"flesh and blood.\\\\\"The opening credits, with the accompaniment of a soft-sounding music, and the opening shot of a calm body of water, with a palace (turns out to belong to the high officials) viewed from afar, are deceiving:what follows from thereon is definitely not soothing to one\\'s senses.Set in World War II Italy, where Benito Mussolini\\'s Nazi-Fascist regime is very much in power, the film depicts the ways in which the dictator\\'s high-standing minions are capable of degrading and brutalizing the citizens,particularly the youth, just to satisfy some perverted and homo-erotic desires.The film is divided in four parts (or \\\\\"chapters,\\\\\" if one may call them so, since the film, it\\'s significant to say, is based on a novel by Marquis de Sade, a controversial and provocative man of letters during his time),where each one represents the stages in which the young, innocent and gentle are deliberately and systematically corrupted and destroyed by the supposed-to-be leaders and guardians of the state---it\\'s like hungry wolves feeding on gentle lambs.\\\\\"Antechamber of Hell\\\\\" shows how a number of young people, most of them beautiful and fresh, are rounded up, brought to the palace and oriented with the \\\\\"rules and regulations\\\\\" that are to govern their existence within the chamber of power---upon hearing them, one gets the impression that this might just be what hell really is.\\\\\"Circle of Obsessions\\\\\" has the state officials weaving tales of eroticism and sensuality to arouse themselves and the youth into making some of the most perverted sexual acts---unabashed nudity, autoeroticism, hedonism, lasciviousness and homoeroticism are strewn all over.\\\\\"Circle of Shit\\\\\" illustrates a further debasement:feeding on others\\' and one\\'s own excrement (there\\'s even a scene where one of the officials lets a young woman urinate right into his mouth) as, if I understand it right, a gesture of wholly accepting the \\\\\"evil\\\\\" in all of us---the \\\\\"stench,\\\\\" to be taken literally and figuratively.The images may truly repel the viewers:a graphic act of defecation, close-up shots of feces (and what a heap!) and the notoriously unforgettable mock wedding reception.Finally, \\\\\"Circle of Blood\\\\\" takes the viewers to \\\\\"salo\\\\\"---the punishing ground, where the young boys and girls who broke some of the \\\\\"rules and regulations\\\\\" are \\\\\"taught their lesson\\\\\" by the men in power.Again, this part is excruciating to watch, for the viewers become witness to some of the most brutally painful acts of punishment:how about an eye being removed, just to give a sample?Now, was Pasolini \\\\\"guilty\\\\\" of, to use film critic Leonard Maltin\\'s words, \\\\\"wallowing in his own sensationalism\\\\\"? I\\'ve yet to read the book on which the film is based, but someone told me that the Italian filmmaker was just being faithful to De Sade\\'s work.Meaning to say, Pasolini tried as much as possible to express visually what the French novelist expressed in words.True, \\\\\"Salo\\\\\" in its entirety is an extremely offensive and shocking film, the kind to which the moviegoing adage \\\\\"Just sit back and relax\\\\\" won\\'t definitely apply.But then, isn\\'t that the kind of response that the film\\'s theme and images should elicit from the viewers in the first place?Not to be disoriented and enraged by the lowest depths into which man\\'s (ab)use of power and satisfaction of primitive cravings and desires can plunge is one of the most absurd things that can ever happen.We should really appreciate artists (directors, novelists, poets, etc.) who have the courage and commitment (an abundance of them, it must be) to explore \\\\\"extreme possiblities\\\\\" inherent in human life.Life isn\\'t always like \\\\\"a box full of chocolates\\\\\"---sweet and comforting---is it?If it ever happens that \\\\\"the people concerned\\\\\" get alarmed, raise concerns about a film and eventually mangle, if not ban, it, it may only prove that the film hits right where it should.',\n",

I was 10 years old when this movie was finished, but I only saw it now. Despite being almost 30 years old, Salo is probably the most cruel and repulsive film ever made, not just here in Italy but in the whole world. It depicts the worse atrocities inflicted to humans by humans. The true dark side of human nature: When evil is born out of simple boredom, when it comes naturally. It is a film that I don't want to see ever again, but at the same time I'm glad it was made. I thought hated it at first, but I now I realized is not true. Of course I don't love it either. I can't decide how to judge it. I don't like the cinematography or the acting. But it was definitely one of the most profound emotional experiences of revulsion I've had in a film. It is a necessary evil if you can endure it.\",\n",

Robert Reford's character embodied the unsuspecting paranoia that characterized that time. A very non-Hollywood ending will surprise you. The cinematography was top-noch (Owen Roizman).

No lost love either -the father lives in the constant fear of being robbed by his own children, until he falls in love with a stranger and imposes her in the over-crowded house, in his wife's very bed. A terrible, cruel picture of the life of the poor, who are refused here the most basic human dignity.

Watching her grow more an more attached to the house is very interesting. The best part I thought was when she surprises her son who drops a crystal bowl that smashes on the floor, and she kneels there, holding the fragments in her hands, sobbing hysterically, almost like a child had died. The boy, Lee Montgomery, I've never had a problem with. The kid from the Shining, now HE was annoying. hehe. And above all, I LOVE how the movie ends. Although it's predictable, it was VERY welcome.

       " 'First of all, let me say that Eraserhead is not a film for everyone.  Many people will find themselves confused by the strange atmosphere, surreal imagery, and signature David Lynch sense of purposefully awkward pacing.That out of the way, I would have to say that this is possibly one of my most personal favorite films.  It is dark, tense, atmospheric, and filled with sounds and images that will send chills up your spine.  It is a film that takes more than one viewing to truly begin to comprehend, but is quite a ride nontheless.  There are moments in this movie that will literally scare you, so much so that one could almost call this eerie surreal art-film a deconstructed domestic horror movie.  This film, along with the original black and white Night of the Living dead, are two of the only films in existance that still scare me to this day. (Side note: Also, I reccomend that you see Luis Bunuel\\'s movie \\\\\"Un Chien Andalou\\\\\" to see where strange art-films like this originated from.)Anyway, the film\\'s plot while initially incomprehensible to most, can be broken down into the tragic tale of a man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) stuck in a dark decaying city overrun by industry.  During the film, he is forced to deal with the prospect of taking care of an illegitimate premature child birthed by his girlfriend, Mary X. (Charlotte Stewart)  However, he is consumed by his guilt, and begins to comprehend suicide as a way out.  But the story is told through such a swirling mixture of dreamlike imagery that this is not always readily apparent.However, in order to better understand and appreciate the film, one must figure out what each of the images mean.  Here\\'s a short cliff notes guidline to some of the more common recurring images in the movie:***THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS***Worm = sin. These creatures appear all throughout the movie.  Henry even tries to hide his \\\\\"little\\\\\" sin from Mary at one point, only to have a nightmare where Mary is consumed by worms.  Henry\\'s room is also filled with piles dirt and dead plants as one might notice, which makes his room a breeding ground for worms.The Baby = The product of sin. You might have noticed that the baby looks an awful lot like a worm. Futhermore, the baby is a part of Henry, and later during the dream sequence, we discover that Henry IS the baby.  When Henry kills the baby, he kills himself.Eraser = Memories. Henry feels that his memories, or his brain with his bad memories, is like an eraser that needs to be rubbed out.  In his dream sequence, he sees himself losing his head, and having his brains turned into eraser bits to be rubbed out and blown into dust on the wind.The lady in the radiator = Death. Death looks grotesque, yet strangely appealing to poor Henry.  The radiator gives off warmth and seems to become a stage where death performs for Henry, promising to stamp out his sins (worms) and telling him that \\\\\"in heaven, everything is fine.\\\\\"  At the end of the movie, Henry embraces the lady in the radiator before blackness falls.The man in the planet = God. In addition to disposing of Henry\\'s cofessed sins at the beginning of the movie (the worm coming out of Henry\\'s mouth) the scarred man in the planet appears to prevent Henry from opting for suicide during his dream sequence. He silently reminds Henry of his sacrifice (the bleeding tree) though it is in vain as Henry shows God what he really is underneith.  (the baby)The last is a theme that occurs in all Lynch movies:Electricity and electrical lighting = The presence of good. Darkness = The presence of evil.There are other aspects of the film that keep popping up, such as the reocurrence of the unlucky number thirteen.  Henry waits thirteen seconds for the elevator to open up, the lady across the hall takes thirteen seconds to appear, Henry\\'s apartment numbers add up to the number thriteen, etc. Also, there are many other images which I will let you figure out on your own.***END OF SPOILERS***All in all, the movie is quite an experience.  This is a film that you will either love or utterly hate.  For myself, I managed to \\\\\"click\\\\\" with the movie from the first time I saw it and have enjoyed it since.  Repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment of the film, as you begin to notice more and more that you never saw before.  All in all, I say that it is an excellent and extremely layered film.With that, I give you some fun facts about the movie:-The pencil eraser machine actually worked.  It was put together by Lynch and a friend of his.-To this day, Lynch will still not disclose how he constructed the amazingly convincing baby creature, though he claims is was created with substance/objects that anyone could find around the house.-Jack Nance\\'s hair was incredibly malleable.  Literally, all it took was a little bit of trimming on either side of his head and some combing to get it to stand upright.-In order to get a better sense of textures for the film (possibly for the organs of the baby) Lynch dissected a dead cat.-When driving around town with the \\\\\"Henry hair\\\\\" Jack Nance would sit in the center seat while Lynch and someone else would sit on either side to keep his gravity-defying hair from being seen.',\n",
       " \"When I critique a film, I usually begin with a synopsis. That is where my problems start with David Lynch's Eraserhead: what with not having a conventional narrative, it doesn't lend itself to being easily synopsised.So let me say that it appears to be about a strange man and matters and characters concerning his strange mutant offspring although any or all of it may be fantasy.I must say initially that I suspect that the movie is very close to showing on screen exactly what David Lynch intended: I can't imagine these images or events being accidental or unintentional.I must then go on to say that I don't like it very much. Not just because it doesn't tell a conventional narrative in a conventional way, although that's part of it. But more because what it shows doesn't please me. The images are unpleasant and unappealing. The main character doesn't invite me to identify with him. I don't understand what Lynch is trying to do, as a result of which I can't engage with the movie on any level except visual and, on that level, Lynch seems to have set out to ply me with a disturbing visual experience which I didn't enjoy.So I have to say that while I admire Lynch's ability to capture something which is, at best odd and, at worst, twisted, it wasn't really my thing.\",\n",

It made me want to see it again. Boy am I glad I did! This film is so much like real life that you not only watch it, you live it. Watching this movie is as intimate an experience as reading a novel. Thus, you are with the protagonist, Cosmo Vitelli, every step of the way. At first glance he appears to be doing nothing-but guess what folks, he\\'s thinking.

You are perplexed, through missing something, but this is even more annoying when you don\\'t quite know what that something is.This is precisely the criticism leveled at The Man Who Fell To Earth, which carries the hallmark of a controversial directorial style. Nicolas Roeg directs this science fiction/drama/love story with one eye on the main event and another on the various sub plots that weave their way in and out of the principal tale. By creating passages of snipped time that do not knit together as logical flashbacks, there is a somewhat disjointed narrative which is seen as a personal indulgence. Many were puzzled enough to claim that the whole project was flawed and that, chronologically, it simply didnt \\\\\"work\\\\\". That is a harsh judgment; the film is highly stylized, but this does not detract from it\\'s undoubted quality. You have to \\'want\\' to understand it and invest a bit of patience. See it twice (I had to) and it will sink in, or read the IMDB reviews to get a taste before you digest it wholeheartedly.Thomas Jerome Newton (David Bowie) lands, as surely all self respecting aliens would choose to do, in New Mexico. How come he is wearing \\'normal\\' clothes? Where did he get the precious metal rings that he wastes no time in trading so eagerly? Why is he carrying an Englishman\\'s passport? These are the kind of questions that confront you at the outset, causing many to bark in dismay. To get the maximum benefit from the film, you simply have to take these unexplained occurrences - and also the rapid and disjointed passing of time - on board, because the whole is more significant and understandable than its component parts.Newton arrives on Earth to suck on the capitalist system, recruiting a top patent\\'s lawyer (Buck Henry - superb as Oliver Farnsworth) along the way to help quickly mould his business idea, World Enterprises, into an immense scientific and commercial colossus. He proceeds to convert the Earthman\\'s physical cash into an enormous scientific solution, in the hope that it will reverse the desperate decline of his own, remote world - and save his family - light years away. A disillusioned college professor, (Rip Torn, magnificent as Nathan Brice) stale with the stench of academia and tired of bedding his female students joins Newton as a chief scientist. He is actually the closest to understanding the man, but he ultimately fails him. The mocked time lapses in this film are, in my view one of it\\'s strengths. It enables us to see Mary Lou (Candy Clark) pass from young humble hotel maid to alcoholic old wretch, via live-in lover and \\'Tommy\\' worshipper. Clark &amp; Bowie share a key scene where Newton decides to reveal his true self: Newton discards his human-eye contact lenses, strips away the false body hair and fingernails. Mary Lou goes hysterical with fear as the real Newton appears in all his extra-terrestrial glory and this is made all the more grotesque when he starts to exude a complete bodily slime during the ensuing love ritual.A special mention should be made of Anthony Richmond\\'s photography, particularly in the spectacular terrain of New Mexico. Indeed, the whole film is a technical masterpiece and the acting is also of the highest level.Of course, the Man Who Fell To Earth is himself beaten at the outset. The Intelligence Services, jealous, as opposed to curious, of his corporate success, want this weirdo brought to order. They achieve this by hounding Farnsworth and infiltrating the company, finally spoiling everything.Imaginative, vibrant, different, ambitious and memorable: class comes in original packaging.

       " 'This is a truly excellent movie. It is quite long, but has a beautiful score and engaging story.. Anthony Quinn is terrific.. The movie also provides a short overview of the early years of Islam and the story of its prophet Mohammad.',\n",
       " \"this is one of the worse movies that i have ever seen.nothing is special about this film,i don't know what was the directors aim,making a film to create a war monger face from Muslims and the great prophet of Islam,or making a movie to show the real story?,the benefit time of the movie(more than70%)has been spent by showing only two events of a big duration:two wars(badr &amp; ohod)so what does it mean? it means that in the history of Islam there were only to big event and those two also were the wars???????? it means that Muslims in those ages were the warmonger people? why there is nothing a bout the miracles of the great prophet of Islam?????????????????\",\n",
       " 'Groundbreaking is the term for this movie...It is considered one of the hundred best movies ever made and for very good reason...Director Sidney Lummet has a reputation for the director of the non-conventional!!...A cogency for making the absolute truth a guileless villain, a rude awakening for television viewers, and a stubborn scripture for facts is what purports a film like Network as a masterpiece for the prolific and intellectual!! You could not ask for better acting!! The acting in this movie is second to none!! Robert Duvall, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, Ned Beatty and a whole list of others...Perhaps the best acting in any film made whatsoever!! It starts with Howard Beale (Peter Finch) a victim of his own human pitfalls...Ossified and dejected from his declining years going from bad to worse, he becomes isolated, desultory ,morbid and morose and feels his life has no meaning, he threatens suicide on live television and is discarded as being a wacko!!...At first!!..but guess what!! he\\'s a hit!!...So the ratings crazed cutthroats make him an instant success by labeling him \\\\\"The Angry Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of Our Time\\\\\"...As long as we\\'ve gone this far, let\\'s break all of the rules...Bring on the terrorists, the soothsayers, the insurectionaries, the financial gurus, the faith healers, and the para military radicals, to reduce the severity of hard bitten news to a side show of carnival freaks!!! William Holden plays the old school business man with \\\\\"primal doubts\\\\\" about his life in general...\\\\\"male menopause\\\\\" with \\\\\"defineable features\\\\\" He is happily married yet after being bombarded from all sides in the autumn of his years, he is frightened that the new generation is impervious to basic tenets of human morality such as ethics and compassion...The woman with whom he gets involved, is callous not because she is vindictive, but because she is emotionless!! This woman (Faye Dunaway) is the \\\\\"Television Incarnate\\\\\" Ice Queen who reduces time and space to \\\\\"split seconds and instant replays\\\\\" the daily business of life is a \\\\\"corrupt comedy\\\\\" and the only redeeming quality to modern marvels and a \\\\\"radiant eruption of Democracy\\\\\" is that it gets a 32 share!!...This acting performance is perhaps the best acting performance I have ever seen...The type of person Dianna Christensen was supposed to be was played out perfectly...The delivery of the elaborated monologues and diatribes were absolutely remarkable....She was ideologically explosive yet person-ably obtuse. You knew why she wasn\\'t the drinking type...she was too emotionally detached...In the thick of women\\'s liberation, whereby a woman wanted to be just like a man, this movie portrayed how being just like a man had it\\'s drawbacks!! \\\\\"Arousing quickly, consummating prematurely\\\\\" and suffering from the cumbersome fate of being crippled by ineptitude at everything else but your work, made Dianna Christensen perennially wistful of testosterone laden aggression!! Aggregately, she invoked societal demise through channels of deductive reasoning!! Director, Sidney Lummet, was insistent that Dianna Christensen be utterly devoid of vulnerability!! Mr Hackett (Robert Duvall) played the hatchet man for the CCA...A rough around the edges errand boy for Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) who viewed this network as his big chance and that whatever worked worked ..Scruples were never an issue, and ratings were pending exchange!! Howard Beale (Peter Finch) the \\\\\"Angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our time\\\\\" surprised even himself with his charismatic clout with the naive television audience!!! He was the UBS star-lighted \\\\\"Mad Prophet of the airways\\\\\"...He could arouse anger and counter-culture overzealousness just by appearing crazy!!! One speech Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) was a bit role but incredibly powerful in his delivery of the basic concept that ideology is for sale and that television is the ultimate vehicle for manipulation!! Paddy Chayefsky is pioneer with this film as an acrimonious depiction for making world phenomena such as the fall of Communism and landing man on the moon to be minimized to a market share!!!..The terms entertainment and egalitarianism now became pejorative!!!! The movie audience is hit with the terrifying reality that a societal caprice will induce the avaricious to capitulate to human catastrophe...Give Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lummet credit for unveiling the revelation that ratings and the dollar take precedence over humanity!!! Howard Beale, the decrepit alcoholic, euphemistically transformed to the prescient paragon of intuitiveness, was alright so long as his innocuous chastisements did not disrupt worldwide pecuniary acquisitions!! Once they did, he was quelled, and thus deemed a total ratings chart disaster!! Ultimately, Howard Beale, the once disheveled dipsomania-cal curmudgeon, turned Messianic Savonarola, becomes the typification of the corporate guinea pig!!!!This movie is avant-garde in it\\'s ability to convey the message of greed first democracy second, or third, depending on the sponsors of the Howard Beale Show... An incident was determined traumatic or not traumatic by it\\'s lucrative marketability potential!! Terrorism is not terrorism if it means ratings!!! The character assassination of all the people in this movie was at the grass roots level!! Their avoidable flaws were entrenched as irreconcilable!! Any people with any conscience whatsoever (William Holden &amp; his wife) were decimated by reveille with selfishness, now it is imperative that they pick up the pieces!! How many imitations of this movie have there been...thousands!! Network however was the first movie of it\\'s kind to effectively portray the concept of \\\\\"dying Democracy and dehumanization\\\\\" probably the best movie of it\\'s kind as well... This is an illustration of how heinous tragedy has to be stomached by the television audience, their response to clinical trauma transcends the impact suffered by the actual victims involved!! It is a proverbial case of ratings eclipsing reality!! The film \\\\\"Network\\\\\" resonates itself to a point whereby the American people are reduced to meager by-products of the Fortune 500!! I wish there could be a movie of this caliber made again!! I am angry that there has not been a sensationalistic masterpiece to come around for some time, and I\\'m as mad as hell and I\\'m not going to take it anymore!!!',\n",
       " 'Thirty years after its release to public praise and multiple Oscar wins, Network is one of those films that instead of dating badly or becoming a product of its time has actually grown and become even more relevant today, and if it were re-released in 2006 for its actual thirtieth anniversary not on film but on national television right at the beginning of the fall season (complete with the most lurid reality TV shows and inane TV pleasers), it would only become more justified in its story.The story of the failing network that didn\\'t have a show on the Nielsen Top 20 and resorted to extreme measures to ensure that this changed seems so today: we see how channels that once had failing ratings churned out shock television right smack in the daytime while still applying Standard and Practices to other \\\\\"prime-time\\\\\" shows that could be taken the \\\\\"wrong\\\\\" way. Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Rikki Lake, Oprah, Mark Burnett, MTV -- they\\'re all here under different guises, all competing to have their voices heard on television, all eventually becoming as ratings-hungry and establishment-friendly as the CEOs running the show.Today we don\\'t quite have Howard Beales ranting and raving about the ills of society on national TV (although they do \\\\\"tell\\\\\" us how we should feel, when we should laugh if we\\'re too stupid to get the joke, who to vote for, the \\\\\"truth\\\\\" about the tobacco industry). Today media is all the rage and televises even a fart if it deems it interesting and guarantees more viewers. Today shows like \\\\\"20/20\\\\\" or \\\\\"60 Minutes\\\\\" bring us \\'exclusives\\' even if it\\'s at the cost of journalistic integrity. And now, with \\'reality TV\\' still the dominating novel trend even in little-seen cable channels, creating stereotypes in leaps and bounds while claiming authenticity of the events depicted, there hasn\\'t yet been a need to create a lunatic who could sermonize everything and make us Mad as Hell. On this aspect alone NETWORK has dated: the 70s were all about counterculture, anti-establishment, revolution, leftists, Patty Hearsts, Lennon and Yoko, \\\\\"Nova\\\\\", the Mansons, the hippies, the Earth-lovers, the militants. Nowadays, buff bodies parade themselves in shows containing outlandish competitions where eating the most grotesque concoctions are the norm, or enduring a barrage of extreme insults has become entertainment (i. e. \\\\\"American Idol\\\\\") and the very concept of dignity flies out the window. Of course, after signing an extensive release form in which they free the network of all responsibilities if something goes wrong because we all know networks can\\'t be held liable for any faux pas. In short, nowadays people from all over try to become the next It person and outlast their 15 minutes of fame. Nowadays, everyone has their own reality TV show depicting their 24 hour day activities. I wonder if Diana Christensen isn\\'t alive and well and exerting absolute control over the networks in general, bringing anything and everything that can garner a little bit of shock value (Boy Meets Boy, or any reality TV self-made \\\\\"villain/villainess\\\\\") and eventual ratings, taking over actual scripted shows with real actors.NETWORK is a powerful movie of which I can\\'t praise enough about even if its screenplay, by Paddy Chayefsky is a little too verbose. No one talks the way he makes his characters talk, using impassioned speeches with big, even archaic, words, and more than once the script makes the characters go completely over the top but even then it makes its point. Of the actors, William Holden\\'s quiet portrayal of a former television exec, Max Schumacher, who has a conscience, but still feels some attraction to danger and risks his own family to experience is who is at the heart of this crazy story who was ahead of its time. Peter Finch\\'s Howard Beale never comes through enough as a real human being: just someone who was pushed too hard and decided to shut down for the remainder of his life. But Holden holds the moral glue of the story, and interestingly enough, is wise to know that his affair, perfectly scripted as he even states, will end on a high note -- he\\'ll return to his sanity and his wife, and Diana Christensen will bask in her own executive madness, since this is all she knows and holds dear. In her last words -- \\\\\"Let\\'s kill the son of a bitch.\\\\\" -- she informs us this is all she is about without so much as batting an eye. Who comes, who goes, is irrelevant to her, as long as the network can be number one. And that is the inhuman reality of television -- a media directed to entertain humans.',\n",
       " \"I saw the movie the week it came out in the theater. The theater was packed. No one in this packed theater laughed at anything. This was because they did not know it was a comedy. To the audience, the movie was a dud. It wasn't funny, and it couldn't be taken seriously. At the end of the movie, most of the people wanted their money back. The acting was good, but the movie tanked. If this movie was so funny, why did none of the three hundred people in the audience laugh? Dark comedy either works, like Fargo, or it bombs.

       " 'In the year 2274, a faction of the human race, following global war and other apparent catastrophes that have ravaged the Earth, live together in a giant domed city, completely sealed off from the outside world. Here, in this bubbled society, the young, healthy, beautiful people who populate it live in total and complete pleasure, free of labor &amp; strife, and free to do anything &amp; everything they want, sexually or otherwise. It\\'s a total state of hedonism.But there\\'s one catch: no one is allowed to live past the age of 30. On your 30th birthday (known as \\\\\"Lastday\\\\\"), the little jeweled lifeclock attached to your hand blinks, and you must be expelled from this society of pleasure through an arena event known as \\\\\"carrousel,\\\\\" in which, the city\\'s young people believe, your soul is \\\\\"renewed,\\\\\" afterwhich you will be reborn into the city\\'s society and start all over again.But some 30 year-olds in this city know the real truth about carrousel---that it is, in fact, a death sentence---and they try to escape. They\\'re called \\\\\"runners.\\\\\" The domed city has a faction of policemen who hunt down runners, and they\\'re called \\\\\"Sandmen.\\\\\" Logan (Michael York) is a 26 year-old Sandman. Life in the city is good for him, but suddenly, he is given a secret mission by his boss---the city\\'s master computer---that will change him. Logan\\'s assignment is to go undercover as a runner, escape the city and go outside, where he is to find a so-called haven for escaped runners called Sanctuary, and destroy it. But Logan soon learns the truth about carrousel himself, and, with the aid of a beautiful girl named Jessica (Jenny Agutter), whom he falls in love with, he must now figure out how to free his people from their horrible fate at the age of 30....1976\\'s \\\\\"Logan\\'s Run\\\\\" is an all-time science fiction classic, and one of my personal favorite films ever since I first saw it on TV as a kid. I\\'ve always been fascinated by the storyline, and although the film\\'s Oscar-winning visual effects have long since been surpassed, they\\'re still quite colorful to look at (including the groundbreaking use of holography). There\\'s fine performances all around, such as the perfectly-cast Michael York as Logan, the very lovely Jenny Agutter as Jessica (she &amp; York have terrific chemistry together), as well as the delightful Peter Ustinov as Old Man (who Logan &amp; Jessica discover living alone with his cats outside the city), Richard Jordan as Logan\\'s best friend Francis, and there\\'s even an enjoyable appearance from Farrah Fawcett (Majors) in her sexy, 70\\'s prime, as an attractive assistant working in a facelift shop called New You. And director Michael Anderson steers the film quite nicely from beginning to end.Some have criticized \\\\\"Logan\\'s Run\\\\\" as being too long, saying that the film bogs down in the middle when Logan &amp; Jessica get outside the city and meet the Old Man. I say hogwash---I\\'ve always enjoyed this part of the film, featuring Ustinov\\'s charming turn as the Old Man. Besides, it\\'s an important part of the story, as Logan &amp; Jessica fall in love with one another, and learn through meeting the Old Man that there IS, in fact, life after 30. Without this segment of the film, \\\\\"Logan\\'s Run\\\\\" would be pointless. It\\'s there for a reason, and I like it just as much as the rest of the film.Upon it\\'s release in 1976, \\\\\"Logan\\'s Run\\\\\" was arguably the \\\\\"hippest\\\\\" sci-fi film ever made up to that point. Then, of course, the original \\\\\"Star Wars\\\\\" was released the following year, which pretty much knocked \\\\\"Logan\\'s Run\\\\\" off the sci-fi pedestal. But no matter---the film remains an enduring classic of it\\'s genre, with a big following to this day. Over 25 years later, \\\\\"Logan\\'s Run\\\\\" is still a ton of futuristic fun. :-)',\n",
       " 'It brought Audrey Hepburn back to the screen after an absence of eight years. It brought Sean Connery and Richard Harris back together again after their teaming in \\\\\"The Molly Maguires\\\\\" and it even brought back Connery and Robert Shaw fourteen years after they fought to the death in \\\\\"From Russia With Love\\\\\". Unfortunately at the time of its release it did not bring back audiences to the theaters. For a movie going public acclimatized to the likes of \\\\\"Jaws\\\\\" and \\\\\"Rocky\\\\\", a film concerned with aging and loss, corruption and mortality was not likely to find very wide acceptance. Today it is generally regarded as a classic and one of the best adult love stories ever filmed. What do heroes do when it\\'s time to call it a day? This is the problem confronting Robin Hood, a legend in his own time, on his return to Sherwood Forest after twenty-five years of fighting in the Holy Land. Should he, as old soldiers are said to do, quietly fade away, or go out in a blaze of glory? Unfortunately Robin is, as his great adversary, The Sheriff of Nottingham wisely observes, \\\\\"A little in love with death.\\\\\" So it is unlikely he will slowly fade away. And Death hangs over the film like an unseen presence. This central theme is given visual emphasis in one of the opening shots. We see three apples set in an open window. Perfect at first, then suddenly an abrupt jump cut showing them rot. This motif of aging and corruption is repeated for the closing of the film as well. We hear Will Scarlett sing about, \\\\\"Following Jolly Robin to the grave.\\\\\" The mortally wounded Richard Lionheart confides to one of his lieutenants his dislike of the cold and dark; when Little John expresses his desire to go see his father again, he is ruefully informed by Friar Tuck that, \\\\\"He died years ago, John...\\\\\" The wistful reaction on Little John\\'s face eloquently expresses regret too profound for words. Visually and verbally death is a constant presence. Indeed, the original script was titled, \\\\\"The Death of Robin Hood.\\\\\" With a title like that it was not going to be a rehash of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. And perhaps that also added to the films lackluster performance at the box-office. Audiences brought up on \\\\\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\\\\" simply could not accept seeing these two beautiful star-crossed lovers ravaged by time, even if they were portrayed by the likes of Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn.However like the Flynn film, \\\\\"Robin and Marian\\\\\" boasts a superb cast. Sean Connery gives one of his great performances. His Robin refuses to acknowledge the approaching infirmities of old age, and like a great ex-athlete attempts to make a comeback in a world that has long since left him behind. Nicol Williamson, woefully under-used in most films has one of his best roles as Little John, the terrible gentle giant who follows Robin with the unquestioning simplicity of a child. He and Connery have the essential chemistry necessary and make an incredibly good team. Robert Shaw brings intelligence, sensitivity and danger to the Sheriff of Nottingham, a man who will ultimately be undone because of those very virtues. Richard Harris does a magnificent turn as King Richard the Lion-hearted. Even though burnt out by years of chasing after glory, he still retains the after-glow of greatness. Ian Holm as his brother Prince John is a wonderful contrast, anxious and insecure, scheming and pleasure loving. His scene with the ambitious, equally scheming Sir Ranulf, the marvelously supercilious Kenneth Haigh, highlights another of the film\\'s themes; the passing of the chivalric age. This is signaled by the death of King Richard, continues with the death of The Sheriff, and is completed by the deaths of Robin and Marian. Prince John and Sir Ranulf symbolize the ascendancy of the modern, hollow man, ambition without vision, loyal only to power and expediency. Prince John, is King as CEO interested only in profit, Sir Ranulf, like the armor he sports, a soulless, mechanical bird of prey. Denholm Elliot as Will Scarlett and Ronnie Barker as Friar Tuck complete Robin\\'s band. Elliott was an actor who could express more with a simple look than most actors can with pages of dialog, and Barker has some nice ironic moments as the Friar. Finally \\\\\"Robin and Marian\\\\\" brought Audrey Hepburn back to the screen, as radiant and lovely as ever. Seeing her first in her nun\\'s garb recalls her appearance in, \\\\\"The Nun\\'s Story\\\\\" sixteen years earlier. Some people have an ageless beauty and Audrey Hepburn had that quality. She and Connery may be the best tragic lovers since Humphrey Bogart told Ingrid Bergman to get on that plane in \\\\\"Casablanca\\\\\". Their scenes together are magic. When Marian asks Robin why he followed Richard during all the years of terrible carnage, Connery sums up his life with a simplicity that is breathtaking; \\\\\"He was my King...\\\\\" The film is wonderfully elegiac and the melancholic sense of time irretrievably lost is heartrending. James Goldman\\'s screenplay is quite simply his best, surpassing his own adaptation of his play, \\\\\"The Lion in Winter\\\\\". Unlike that film Goldman refuses to indulge in pithy witticisms at the expense of period flavor. John Barry\\'s bittersweet score and Richard Lester\\'s austere direction never descend into sentimentality and underscore the tragedy of the two lovers reunited after spending half a lifetime apart. David Watkins\\'s gritty cinematography beautifully captures the squalor of life in the medieval age. \\\\\"Robin and Marian\\\\\" is a bittersweet adult love story for discriminating viewers of all ages.',\n",

I kept hoping it would improve but it stayed at an unfortunate one rating.So this is a warning that this film is terrible and without any saving grace. I admire Fassbinder as a director and he has made some fine films but for some reason he lost it on this one.It is supposed to be a comedy but I found no humor in it, black or otherwise. Even the nude scenes don't help the film. There is absolutely no story line or reason for making this film.\",\n",

There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky, and together they make life livable. The rest of the cast is other down and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rocky gets his chance.  This film is touching, and unforgettable.\",\n",

       " \"All of the credit in the world goes to John Wayne for making this film. Here you have the biggest star in Hollywood history, making a film that symbolizes his life. You have an aging actor, whose best days were past him, portraying an aging gunfighter, whose best days were behind him. You have a character trying to fit into a world that had changed too much. Much like Wayne was trying to fit into a changing America. Lastly, you had a character, dying of cancer, trying to accomplish one last thing. Wayne, who was also dying of cancer, like the character, was trying to accomplish one last thing, a great film. To me, this film is special, because you are seeing in real life, a dying icon make his farewell. Like the character JB Books, Wayne was trying to put a brave face on his final days. He was vulnerable and uncertain about what awaited him, but he sought to accomplish one last goal. I don't care if you like Wayne or not, but how someone could not be emotionally effected by seeing this legend on screen for his last time, well, I feel sorry for you. This film is very special to me.\",\n",
       " \"A towering classic of American cinematic power.  Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones.  The film fools you on a first viewing.  Is Travis an endearing eccentric?  Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing.  But on a second view, you see it for what it is.  The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift.  This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially.  Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed.  With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show.  The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)?  Nothing at all.  He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives.  But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever.  But far more important than that, this film will survive as a universal, ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind.  The story doesn't end when the credits roll.  We know Travis will snap again.  But the story doesn't end with Travis either.  It continues today in the cities and in the schools.  The film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind.This film didn't cause the incidents in Colombine, or Hawaii, or Seattle, or wherever you care to look, even with all of its disturbing images of violence.  It didn't cause those things.  It predicted them.\",\n",
       " 'The script of \\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\" is built like a diary, the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam, because he can\\'t sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can\\'t, while violence accumulates inside him. One of those unnoticed people with dark things on their mind, one of those who break up the news one day with some extraordinary outburst of rage, to fall back immediately into anonymity.The gradual transformation of man into beast in this movie is chilling. It\\'s still funny and pathetic when the hero threatens himself in front of the mirror (\\\\\"you\\'re talking to me?\\\\\"), but when he comes out with a mohawk hairdo and dark glasses, it is obvious that nasty stuff is going to take place. As in \\\\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\\\", violence is recuperated by society depending on what purpose it is used for. Whereas he was about to murder the candidate for presidency, \\\\\"god\\'s lonely man\\\\\" fails and instead kills a vicious pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. The potential criminal becomes a hero for a day.Such stories happen everywhere of course, but it seems that the bewildering atmosphere of New York City\\'s summer night was the best choice. \\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\" gives us a very realistic approach of New York, in a way that is not seen on screen so often, at least not anymore, whilst that city is probably the one in the world that has been filmed the biggest number of times.Most of the movie takes place at night. The credits open on the blazing lights of the yellow taxi cab moving slowly in the dark rainy streets. A kaleidoscope of neonlight appears through the dripping windows as the driver\\'s eyes blink in the front mirror. The night is the hero\\'s universe, it\\'s the time when \\\\\"all the animals come out\\\\\", as he says. By contrast, the few daylight scenes look somewhat off-key, but this was definitely intentional.The final scene still appears today as extremely violent, but at least, it shows murder for what it is. Brutal, ugly, crude. It is something one tends to forget about after seeing so many police series where people get shot so often that it gets casual. Real violence is not casual when you face it, and here is a film that makes you face it.The directing is first class and deservedly made path for Scorsese as a world renowned artist. Some techniques he used here are unusual for American cinema, like focusing on details for a few seconds. The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer Bernard Herrman who died before the picture was even released.Two of the actors also deservedly made it to stardom. Robert de Niro plays a very unglamorous character, but his presence on screen is so intense that it\\'s no wonder it made such an impression. As for Jodie Foster, she already appeared in films as a child, but playing a teenage prostitute was certainly not an easy challenge, and probably it was that role that really turned her into a major actress.\\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\" was a big hit when it came out, both for the public and the critics. It won the Palme d\\'Or in Cannes, and served as a trend setter for many later films, like for instance Quentin Tarantino\\'s and Abel Ferrara\\'s. But even today, the original model seems difficult to emulate, probably because achieving a masterpiece is a rare thing, by definition.',\n",

Taxi Driver is just all together a great film that is absolutely perfection. Martin Scorcesse who also was just really starting out made this movie that brought us back to the film noir genre. He made this great classic and I don\\'t even think he realized how much it would stand against the test of time, to this day we still know this film and even if you don\\'t know it, you know the infamous speech \\\\\"You talking\\' to me?\\\\\". This is a film about isolation, loneliness, and self destruction at it\\'s worst.Travis Bickle who claims to be an honorably discharged Marine it is implied that he is a Vietnam veteran is a lonely and depressed young man of 26. He settles in Manhattan, where he becomes a night time taxi driver due to chronic insomnia. Bickle spends his restless days in seedy porn theaters and works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Bickle becomes interested in Betsy, a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine. She is initially intrigued by Bickle and agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. On their date, however, Bickle is clueless about how to treat a woman and thinks it would be a good idea to take her to a sex film. Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain. Rejected and depressed, Bickle\\'s thoughts begin to turn violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training. He buys a number of pistols from an illegal dealer and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm \\\\\"You talking\\' to me?\\\\\". Bickle is revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift, Iris, a 12-year-old child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her pimp. Shocked by the occurrence, Bickle fails to drive off and the pimp, Sport, reaches the cab. Later seeing Iris on the street he pays for her time, although he does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind. But after her rejection as well, Travis decides to take things into his own hands, \\\\\"Pow!\\\\\".This is one of the most memorable movies of all time and has really stood it\\'s ground. It\\'s personally one of my favorites and made me fall in love with Robert DeNiro all over again. The script to Taxi Driver is just so incredibly powerful and the performances were just perfect. Jodie Foster, this little girl at the time was such a presence on screen, she pulls in what was a very tricky performance and was hauntingly beautiful. Cybill Sheppard was also very beautiful and I was absolutely in love with her character and felt so bad for her. Everything about Taxi Driver is just great, I don\\'t know how much I could go on about the love I have for this film. It\\'s a film that you will never forget and trust me, if you haven\\'t seen it, go out and rent it immediately, you won\\'t regret it. It\\'s bloody, it\\'s twisted, it\\'s crazy, but it\\'s one of the best films of all time.10/10',\n",
       " 'Despite what some might see as limited by technical flaws and/or as an overly simplistic plot, Taxi Driver deserves its critical reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. Some 23 years later, the existential plight of Travis Bickle, \\\\\"God\\'s lonely man,\\\\\" continues to pack a hard emotional punch. In fact, it\\'s hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader\\'s fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation.',\n",
       " '\\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\" starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer, Bernard Hermann, as we see the blurred city of New York as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion. \\\\\"Taxi Driver\\\\\" is one of Martin Scorsese\\' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It\\'s an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It\\'s extremely well acted even though it\\'s a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it\\'s carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro\\'s second best work to \\\\\"Raging Bull,\\\\\" and among the finest acting performances of all time. Travis Bickle is the self proclaimed, \\\\\"God\\'s lonely man.\\\\\" Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy, crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes, he goes unnoticed; like a ghost meandering through life\\'s morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man, with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don\\'t see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He\\'s ready for war, and the table is set. The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dream-like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot (possibly signifying Bickle\\'s departure from the world?) of the carnage left in Bickle\\'s wake. Then there\\'s the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene, which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes, degenerates, and the scum of the earth. He\\'s treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause: Kill 5 scumbags, save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she\\'s no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He\\'s quiet, reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After, Travis drops Betsy off, he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple, \\\\\"So long.\\\\\" As Travis drives off, he menacingly looks back into the mirror, representing a problem still exists, then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle\\'s brooding, boiling, rage within; symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn\\'t cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn\\'t make it any better. He\\'s still ready for war.',\n",
       " 'Sometimes I wish Woody Allen was cool and self confident, and not always nervous, unsure and geeky all the time. But you can\\'t deny that he\\'s a very intelligent person. His best film, the quiet and understated masterpiece \\\\\"Annie Hall\\\\\", is so full of jokes and inventive style it can make your head spin. Actually, this is one film I wish I had a script of so I could slowly read all those dialogs which are being said too fast. In 1978 \\\\\"Annie Hall\\\\\" beat \\\\\"Star Wars\\\\\" and won 4 Oscars ( Best picture, director, screenplay, actress Diane Keaton ) and one Golden Globe ( Best actress Diane Keaton ).-------- The simple comedy about a romance between the New York comedian Alvy and Annie is enriched by tons of emotions and inventive film techniques which even Jean-Luc Godard would be jealous of. In one scene Alvy is talking to Annie about art while the subtitles are presenting his *real* words, about how he wants to take her out! In the other they are having intercourse in bed while Annie\\'s ghost/mind is absent and sitting on a chair! Alvy is walking down the street and saying how he watched the animated movie \\\\\"Snow White and the seven dwarfs\\\\\" and fell in love with the witch and presto, in the next scene he is drawn in animation in the middle of that film, having an argument with his lover, the witch. The list goes on and on.I remember that I couldn\\'t watch this film when I was a kid. I found it to be too boring. But today I completely understand it. You just have to think about it. Like when Alvy is so happy he says to Annie that he doesn\\'t just love her, but that he \\\\\"luurves her, loaves her and luuf\\'s her.\\\\\" Also, some of the gags are simply quietly hilarious, like when the hero is narrating his society as a child, commenting on everything ( \\\\\"Those who don\\'t know nothing, teach. Those who don\\'t know how to teach, teach gym. And those don\\'t know even that, teach at our school.\\\\\" ).Grade: 10/10',\n",

There is one apparently nude scene of the boys by the lake (although nothing is showing...this type of scene is more acceptable by Swedish standards), and 3. There is killing (by arrows, spears, burning...no gore however).Have you ever wanted to see a movie where the heroes die?  Well, this is it. The Lionheart boys die...twice.  It seems every time these boys die they go to a different world.  The first time to Nangiola; and then at the end of the movie to Nangalima.  Now if this movie were from Hollywood, I\\'d smell \\\\\"sequel.\\\\\"The majority of the movie takes place in Nangiola, where Karl (Crispy) and Jonathan Lionheart help the good guys (the folks from cherry blossom valley &amp; wild rose valley).  They are fighting an evil warlord (Tingle) who...what else...wants to take over the whole place.  Tingle just happens to have a dragon too...a sorry beast that looks more like a stuffed walrus on fire.This movie is a sorry mess.  The music score is just plain dreadful.  The acting...well...my dog is better.  Were those kids wearing wigs?  And effects?...what effects.  They even tried (unsuccessfully) the old \\\\\"Wizard of Oz\\\\\" trick using sepia tone at the beginning and then changing to colour when the boys enter Nangiola. But those black capes worn by Tingle\\'s bad guys which had purple linings were hilarious.  This one gets a 2 out of 10.If you can find this movie, it\\'s worth a laugh or two just for its weirdness.  I actually found this one on a cheap DVD in Singapore...dubbed in English no less.  (It might have been a bootleg!  Naaa...nobody would bootleg such a bad movie!)',\n",
       " \"The movie is a cut above most cinematic portrayals of historical events, likely due to it's being based on historian Cornelius Ryan's excellent book, and it's not as overproduced or staged as the film version of another of his books, The Longest Day. The producer admits to crediting one assault to the Americans, when in the event the British were first to attack, but overall the movie relates a good sense of history and geography, and respects the timeline of the actual events. It shows the national and class tensions affecting the Allied leadership, and gives a sense of the character of the participants. The writing gives the plethora of good actors something to work with despite no single leading role (and it's fun to watch so many actors in a single film.) Relevant information is included in the character's dialogue rather than through narration. The editing adds to the flow of events, balancing the suspense borne by the individuals involved with interest and action for the viewer. Add in the Intelligent direction by Richard Attenborough, and it makes this one of my favorite World War Two films.\",\n",

Lest we forget!\",\n",
       " 'Richard Attenborough\\'s monumental war drama is about one of the most stirring battles of World War II, based on the best-seller by Cornelius Ryan... The film presents the most impressive all-star cast ever assembled for a single production...World War II\\'s \\\\\"Operation Market Garden\\\\\" would have put the Allies in control of the major road leading into the industrial Ruhr, the heart of the German war machine... The war would have ended in a matter of weeks... Instead, what Market Garden left in its wake, through a combination of costly miscalculations, bad weather, battlefield politics and tactical errors, were more than 17,000 British, American, Dutch and Polish casualties, nearly twice as many dead as in Normandy...On Sunday, September 17th, 1944, the largest assemblage of gliders, bombers, transports and fighters ever involved in a single mission flew over eastern Holland, and dropped 35,000 assault troops along the 64 mile road corridor between Belgium and Arnhem, the Dutch city on the Rhine River...This airborne army - the Market phase of the operation - was assigned the task of taking and holding the six major bridges along the corridor... Smashing through the crumbling German resistance along the way, the British Corps tanks and infantry - the Garden phase - were to link up with the paratroops and, with their help, drive the retreating armies of the Third Reich back into their own homeland...The Germans, however, correctly guessed the British plan and formed a ring of armor around the approaches to the bridge at Arnhem... The result was near slaughter for all the allied forces and an enormous number of German dead...Col. John Frost (Anthony Hopkins) and the survivors of his 2nd Battalion battered their way through heavy German fire to the northern end of Arnhem bridge, where they took up a strong position in houses over-looking the entire bridge...For four long days and nights, Frost and his \\'valiant few\\' held this tenuous position against superior German tanks and infantry... The Dutch civilian helped by piling the bodies of the dead - friend and enemy alike - in forbidding barricades across each major street to prevent Germans from reaching Frost and his men at the bridge...Major General Roy Urquhart (Sean Connery), Brigadier James Gavin (Ryan O\\'Neal), Lieut.Col Joe Vandeleur (Michael Caine) and the rest of the Allied commanders met with much the same resistance and disaster...At the Nijmegen highway bridge it became obvious that the British tanks would be stopped until the bridge\\'s northern end could be taken by an assault crossing of the Waal River... This brave action, executed in a full clear day under murderous German fire by Major Julian Cook (Robert Redford) and his battalion, has been described by witnesses as one of the most heroic deeds of arms in World War II...Delayed by ground fog in England, both replacements and badly-needed supplies were late in arriving... Communication was so bad; most of the food and ammunition fell into the hands of the Germans...The Polish Parachute Brigade, under Major General Sosabowski (Gene Hackman) command, held up three days by the fog, finally made their drop into a deadly thick shower of German rifle and machine gun fire... Many died before they touched ground, and the rest met with further disaster...Casualties were enormous and the hundreds of British wounded were placed in the Beautiful home - of Dutch heroine Kate Ter Horst (Liv Ullman) - offered as a surgery and the small hotels provided some bed space for the worst casualties... Laurence Olivier (Dr. Spaander) wins a cease-fire from the German Lieut. General Wilhelm Bittrich (Maximilian Schell), in order to bury the dead and surrender the wounded...Meanwhile, Col. Frost and the last few at Arthem bridge were taken prisoners by the Germans... Only a few escaped... Vandeleur\\'s advance was stopped cold... Urquhart hopelessly surrounded planned a retreat down the river... The Germans, lighting the river with rockets, began firing on the fleet and only some made it to the other side...The following morning, Padre Pere, a British Chaplain who stayed behind with his wounded men, noticed the mysteriously frightening silence that prevailed throughout the whole Oosterbeck area... All of the surviving patients realized that they were now German prisoners... The battle of Arnhem was over...This is an enormous story of an horrifying human disaster... A plan formulated by Field-Marshal Montgomery and sanctioned by General Eisenhower... The film shakes you... The pity of it touches you...Richard Attenborough has consolidated his position in the British cinema by directing notable films based on true characters and events: \\\\\"Young Winston,\\\\\" \\\\\"A Bridge Too Far\\\\\" and then had a phenomenal success with \\\\\"Gandhi,\\\\\" winner of 8 Academy Awards...',\n",
       " 'The Car is a good example of how restraint in the horror genre can work. It honors the tradition of real suspense movies by hinting at more than it shows, and inferring more than it explains. From the cryptic opening quote by Anton Le Vey to the ending in which the two main characters disagree on whether this is really the end, this \\\\\"demon car\\\\\" film keeps asking more questions than it answers. For some, this will bring frustration, for others, it makes the movie that much more fascinating. The \\\\\"body count\\\\\" is a total of 10 people, with no explicit scenes.

       " \"This film is so terrible there are no words in the English language to describe it, which must be why it was made in French. In fact, there are only two French words which apply: 'le neant' ('nothingness') and 'merde.' To roll out a few English adjectives just to give an idea: this film is pretentious, revolting, boring, offensive, empty, worthless, pointless, and one could go on like that for some time. The characters are those typical French spoilt brat university students of the 1970s still in the grip of the horrible Jean-Paul Sartre and his phoney existentialism. They search for meaning in a tepid sort of way (inert, more like it), but of course find none. When you start out by being convinced that nothing has any meaning, and then glance around you just in case you might see some lurking in a dusty corner, you are bound to see nothing there but rubbish. It is inconceivable to me what kind of person could possibly praise this film. Two pseud reviewers from leading newspapers are quoted on the DVD box, and one says this film is 'A masterpiece ... A film that is impossible to forget.' Well, try me.\",\n",
       " 'This was a real change of pace for director Martin Scorsese--he decided to do a drama/love story with music set in the 1940s. But he wanted a DOWNBEAT film. It was released in 1977 (after about 20 minutes were cut out by the studio) and was torn apart by the critics. It was reissued in 1981 with all the cut footage restored (it now runs 165 minutes) and the critics raved about it! Go figure. After that, however, it seemed to disappear. Too bad--it\\'s actually good.It\\'s about clarinet player Jimmy Doyle (Robert De Niro) falling in love with Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli). She\\'s a singer and they preform together in the same band. But Jimmy has serious temper problems and when Francine gets pregnant things go out of control.The film is certainly stunning to look at--the sets and cinematography are just great. Some of the sets are (quite obviously) fake but it actually works in this movie. It seems to be a homage to the big, splashy Technicolor musicals of the 1940s and 1950s--but has its characters act like real people and deal with adult situations. The direction by Scorsese is (of course) wonderful. What\\'s especially surprising is his directing of the big \\\\\"Happy Endings\\\\\" musical number (which was originally completely cut)--who knew Scorsese could direct a musical?The acting is good--almost too good. Minnelli is very good as Francine--she\\'s just magical when she sings and there\\'s a powerful sequence when she just explodes in the back of a car. De Niro plays Doyle as an insensitive jerk--and that\\'s the main problem with this film. His character is loud, immature, obnoxious and always pushing Minnelli around. More than once I wanted her to turn around and punch him out. His character is so unlikable it\\'s hard to really give a damn about him. But Minnelli is beautiful and likable and the sets are unbelievable. The music is great and when Minnelli sings \\\\\"New York New York\\\\\" you can\\'t take your eyes from the screen. Also old time stage actor Larry Kert (who sadly died on AIDS in 1991) pops up at the \\\\\"Happy Endings\\\\\" sequence--what a voice!A lot of people find this film sick and too dark--it is, but it IS a Martin Scorsese film.

In a style where sudden visual shocks are used to thrill the audience, Argento creates elaborate deaths which cannot be quickly forgotten.  The highly involved double-murder towards the beginning of the film still remains one of the most memorable scenes in horror history, standing next to the Psycho \\\\\"shower scene\\\\\" in pure sensory input. And in a technique so powefully employed here and here alone, Argento sets scene after scene aglow with color, using it to express the mood in ways only the subconscious can fully appreciate.

Their next mission MUST succeed or the funding is axed and the entire agency vanishes. That next mission is the first manned landing on Mars and it is going very smoothly indeed, to the awe and excitement of the U.S.A. and the entire world. What the world outside of the space agency doesn\\'t know is that the whole mission is fake. It\\'s been set up and broadcast from a deserted military base 300 miles west of Houston.It seems a critical piece of equipment proved faulty too late to abort the project and so the space agency (it is never directly called N.A.S.A.)-- in cahoots with shadowy, high government powers -- had pulled the three astronauts from the capsule moments before launch, whisked them to the deserted base, explained the situation, pleaded for their (reluctant)cooperation through some not-so-subtle intimidation, and all has been peaches and cream and now it looks like their \\\\\"re-entry and landing\\\\\" will be near perfect albeit 200 miles off-course so that they can get the spacemen back into the capsule.Nothing is going to ruin this mission.So what if one of the console technicians has noticed that the TV broadcasts are earthbound, not from space? He simply disappears.Nothing is going to ruin this mission.ALmost nothing: a bad circuit in one of the other consoles claims that the heat shield has separated from the capsule upon re-entry and all three astronauts burned alive in the capsule. But they are alive and well in a deserted base in Texas . . . and they know that they are expendable.Nothing is going to ruin this mission.The chase is on between 3 frightened pilots, a far-flung, well organized cover-up machine, two relentless black-ops helicopters, and a lazy, cynical reporter (friend of the missing console jockey) who smells a rat.Writer/Director Hyams has build himself one slick, fast-paced thriller from a script conceived during his CBS reporter days covering Vietnam. It was there that he envisioned how easy it could be for a huge government to cover up anything it wished. In the post-Moonwalk years, when some wing-nut conspiracy groupies insisted NASA had faked the moon landing, Hyams found his base plot and it works like a charm! The casting is near perfect. Dependable old Hal Holbrook is the head of the space agency, in over his head and resigned to having to kill his crew, including the team leader (Brolin); his friend of 16 years. Nothing is going to ruin this mission. Brolin, O.J. Simpson, and Sam Waterston never really get any chance for character development, save for Waterston\\'s likable wise-cracking. Brenda Vacarro and Karen Black give equally strong performances; David Huddleston is dead on as the Florida senator in support of the space program. In tow with James Karen as the Vice President, they have some enjoyable moments satirizing Washington Double-Speak; Robert Walden, as the doomed console technician, gives an intense, sad, dark sense of puzzlement in his performance of a man who is trying to help but feels like he\\'s to blame. Elliot Gould just normally comes across to me as someone sleeping his way through a role, but for this picture it is perfect for the character of reporter Caulfield. This sleepy, cynical, unenergetic man who is slowly putting the pieces together and too frightened to say his surmises out loud, is deftly handled through Gould\\'s stock-in-trade persona.I really felt that David Doyle and Telly Savalas should\\'ve switched roles. Neither man was truly convincing in his performance and their characters might have been better served being traded between them.However, the real star of the film is Bill Butler, the Director of Photography. What he releases on your screen is an artful array of cinema: The pull back, and cross pan shots of the in-studio Mars terrain; the terrifying out-of-control car Gould is trying to avoid being pulverized in; the quiet terror of Hal Holbrook\\'s office as he makes and takes his telephone calls; Those evil insect-like helicopters in landing or in flight; the dark dread in the cave as Brolin, hiding from the pursuers, confronts a nasty viper; the stark, dry brittleness of the desert that Brolin, Waterston, and Simpson must challenge; The strain and exhaustion of Waterston as he scales the dry mountain side to escape his fate, but in vain. But most of all it is the exciting, jolting aerial ballet of the copter and bi-plane chase. It draws you in visually to the point of giving you a queasy stomach! (Yes, I know. There are no mountains in central Texas. There are no 50 feet tall gorillas in New York City either, but you enjoyed King Kong didn\\'t you?) The icing on the cake of Butler\\'s images and Hyams well done script is the pounding, driving score by Jerry Goldsmith. It is all beats of percussion, plucks of strings and short orchestral punches. It gives a sense of impending doom, fear, conspiracy, and paranoia.While it is safe to say that N.A.S.A is the most non-political, benign department of the government, an agency whose efforts have given the public such fruits of success as the microwave oven, superior fibers for insulation, freeze-dried foods, and Tang, just to name a scant few, if you can put your common sense on hold and believe that the space agency could be cold, crisp, self-serving, and ruthless enough to kill to stay alive, then you\\'ve come to the right movie.',\n",

I grew up in a very small town and come from a working class ( Norwegian, Scots-Irish, English) background. Two weeks out of high school and at the age of 17 I enlisted in the Army. Like the men in this movie I came from a tradition of serving one\\'s country in the military. Both my brother, two cousins and my future brother-in-law also served in the Vietnam War.I identify with Michael, played by Robert DeNiro in his sense of honor in going back to \\'Nam and trying to bring back his buddy Nick. Additionally I admire Mike when he visits Steven in the VA hospital and brings him back home. Honor is, as mentioned in the movie \\\\\"Rob Roy\\\\\", a gift a man gives to himself. Michael (and the movie) doesn\\'t waste time on whether the war in Vietnam is right or wrong. Michael just does what he thinks is right with respect to his buddies. Ask any one who has served in the military and they will tell you that you\\'re sense of commitment to your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment to your country.I do not see this movie as either pro or anti-Vietnam War. To me the movie portrays how war affects three individuals. It is a movie about character, honor, loyalty------what you are when everything around you is falling apart. I will continue to see this movie many times as I hope that the values depicted in it will still be reflected (albeit weakly) in me.In closing, I can not help to remember that the politically anti-Vietnam War movie \\\\\"Coming home\\\\\" starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight was also up for the same Oscars. When Jane Fonda was asked what movie would win the Academy award that year, she sneeringly replied that she hoped it wasn\\'t \\\\\"The Deer Hunter\\\\\". In the years since Jon Voght has transitioned from being a Liberal to a Conservative. Parenthetically, Jane Fonda has never apologized for her pro-Viet Cong actions. At the age of 66, I am still proud that I served my country and volunteered for the US Army and the Vietnam War.',\n",

       " \"There was a time when one's age played less a role in relationships than our current society demands today. It was very common 2 generations ago for women of 13 years old to give birth - especially at a time of, or after war. This film shows how love can develop during such a time and provides an example of unrestricted affection. The French artist who directed this film did not feel an obligation to be sensitive to the feelings of USA viewers, so don't be swayed by the moralistic outrage these people feel obligated to spew. Watch the movie and decide for yourself. While doing so, ask yourself how WAR and VIOLENCE could have ever gained such universal and unquestioning acceptance in our current society than LOVE and SEX -- regardless the form. Which is more obscene ?\",\n",
       " 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978) is one of the most notorious pictures ever released during the seventies. Along with LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and Thriller: A cruel picture, it\\'s one of the greatest revenge flicks of that era. A feminist writer goes out to the country so she could have some peace and quiet whilst working on her first novel. Instead she runs into a group of male locals who decide to have some fun with her. Unlike many other movies of this ilk, I.S.O.Y.G. is not like other\\\\\"exploitation films\\\\\". There is nothing sexual or provocative in this picture. The director wanted to show what it\\'s like to be raped and the after effects of such a traumatizing event. He went through great lengths in research and from his own personnel experience. I found it to be a very different film than all of the others that deal with the same subject matter. The film-making (for a first time director) was very well done and for the most part the acting was up to par. I am proud to admit that I have this film as part of my collection. Don\\'t believe the hype. This is a good movie. Highly recommended.P.S. The subject matter is real graphic, but rape is not enjoyable. The director did an excellent job of portraying the true horror of it instead of hollywoodizing this dirty, degrading act.',\n",
       " 'I have just recently been through a stage where I wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90\\'s can\\'t hold a candle to 70\\'s and 80\\'s horror films. I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don\\'t know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday\\'s so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don\\'t rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don\\'t need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don\\'t. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can\\'t be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It\\'s the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don\\'t know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett, \\\\\" I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. \\\\\" That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn\\'t. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn\\'t. But it\\'s astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock\\'s steps, maybe director\\'s should follow in his.Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don\\'t know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won\\'t let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don\\'t know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90\\'s, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven\\'s final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?And just to follow up after seeing Zombie\\'s version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn\\'t take away from the brilliance of this one.',\n",
       " \"This is the best college comedy ever made. Nothing has ever come close to comedic perfection, and never will again. The early bird director John Landis directs this film into greatness bringing stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Tom Hulce, Mark Metcalf and Donald Sutherland to the screen in brilliance. True, this film is just about a bunch of misfits defying authority in a campus of 1962, but that's what makes it so good, and original. Belushi, Metcalf, and others bring many of the laughs here, but it is mainly it's reputation that brings this film into hilarity. A landmark in cinema comedy. By the way, screenwriters Harold Ramis and Chris Miller originally were going to make this a film about Charles Manson called Laser Orgy Girls, so thank god Douglas Kenney came in and straightened this out to the right part.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s interesting that another re-make is coming out this year. Man, time flies because I vividly remember when this movie came out and the excitement it caused. This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects, so it was pretty cool, to say the least.It\\'s still very entertaining, and the more I watch this the more I\\'m amused with the villain (Gene Hackman as \\\\\"Lex Luthor\\\\\") and the lines he delivers. He\\'s a funny guy. Christopher Reeve, meanwhile, was always a popular \\\\\"Man Of Steel\\\\\" and the special effects are still fun to watch, from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits. There\\'s a solid soundtrack to this, too.Personally, I didn\\'t care for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again, Lane\\'s character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying, too. I guess it comes with her character. However, being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence (it\\'s now on DVD, by the way, and worth a purchase), it was just too weird hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were!Anyway, this is simply great entertainment. As a superhero, Superman has always been THE MAN. Three sequels followed this film, the second one being the best in my opinion.',\n",

My dad used to take me shooting rabbits, but after Watership Down I never went again. The graphics may not be as high quality as some of the newest releases but don't let that put you off. It is a remarkable film and I loved it. Don't think that older films are no good because Watership Down is AMAZING!

       " \"The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !\",\n",
       " \"Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic, documentary-like sci-fi films ever made. Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 10/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company)\",\n",
       " 'ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android \\\\\"revival\\\\\" are fairly notorious). There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt\\'s encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit\\'s search of the ship air ducts to Weaver\\'s terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word of warning, however: you\\'ll need to send the kids to bed for this one. And you\\'ll probably be up half the night afterward yourself! Recommended.Gary F.

I sat through 'Being There' chuckling at Seller's wonderful 'Zen-like' performance, enjoying its gently satirical look at the vacuous nature of political debate, safe in the knowledge that I was in on the joke: Chance is an idiot but the real idiots are almost everyone else in the film who see profundity when they're given pap. And then, in a scene that completely flips the film on its head, Chance walks on water! That scene is the cinematographic equivalent of staring at one of those stereograms when the hidden 3D image suddenly leaps out at you. It's a shocking moment, beautifully handled, and you're immediately forced to question everything you've seen in the film and your assumptions about it: why does Chance have no concept of time? Is it because an eternal being wouldn't need one? When Eve makes a pass at Chance is he being tempted by, and tested against, original sin? Was the Washington Cop who, we assume, is calling in a report of a simpleton on the loose, actually compelled to do exactly what Chance told him to do? Does Chance speak Russian? How? Is this because all the tongues of man are as one to him? Does Chance have the power to decide when the time is right for Ben to die? Did the 'old man' meet a similar fate, and does Chance lay his hand on the old man's forehead to see if he is cold or to bless him?If we accept that Chance has indeed revealed his divinity to us then the whole film flips once more and takes on a far darker aspect. Is the decline in the Presidents powers linked to the rise of Chance? Is his TV broadcast the modern equivalent of the 'sermon on the mount'? And, crucially, is all his talk of gardening a chilling metaphor for the immanent fate of mankind?A shepherd might be content to tend his flock, but Chance is a gardener, and he might have a great deal of pruning and weeding to do before Eden \\\\u0096 his garden - is restored to its former glory.

       " 'Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it\\'s also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d\\'Or at Cannes and it\\'s constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \\\\\"Hearts of darkness\\\\\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It\\'s an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It\\'s a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there\\'s just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character\\'s inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante\\'s perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can\\'t comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \\\\\"heroic\\\\\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner\\'s Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\\\\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it\\'s at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he\\'s experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can\\'t return to a normal state of mind.The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he\\'s able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz\\'s place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn\\'t, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola\\'s eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It\\'s here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \\\\\"hell\\\\\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film\\'s runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer\\'s breath away. Coppola\\'s direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz\\'s first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn\\'t hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it\\'s a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola\\'s magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.',\n",
       " 'Francis Ford Coppola\\'s \\\\\"Apocalypse Now\\\\\" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film\\'s production levels.Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors \\\\\"The End\\\\\" as Martin Sheen\\'s Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard\\'s mission is to \\\\\"terminate... with extreme prejudice\\\\\" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is \\\\\"out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.\\\\\" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior.Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen\\'s raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man\\'s power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard\\'s slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz\\'s.Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn\\'t. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola\\'s actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man\\'s fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film\\'s 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola\\'s sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen\\'s haunted soldier Willard.I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today\\'s standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola\\'s masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend.That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis.',\n",

       " \"During the final throes of the Vitnam war, our central character, Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has allegedly gone 'completely insane', but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country.The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this.Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened lair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff.The bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard,--interlaced with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, nay, genius, film. The closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols. Coppolla has made, intentionally or not, the ultimate anti-war statement, one that should resonate through the ages.\",\n",

       " \"In the 29 years of Alcatraz's existence, and despite the strict measures, 39 captives tried to escape from America's premier maximum-security prison during its existence... Thirty six of whom failed... This script is about the other three, of whom nothing is known... They may have drowned in San Francisco Bay, or they may have got away...Morris (Clint Eastwood) was a loner, a rebel against society, the perfect hero that Siegel loves... Lee Marvin in 'The Killers', Steve McQueen in 'Hell is for Heroes', and Richard Widmark in 'Madigan' were all similar types in films which he had directed..In 'Escape From Alcatraz,' Eastwood gives his best screen acting to date... It is a charismatic performance that is so idiosyncratic, persuasive, and powerful... Eastwood, gave Morris the rough, intelligent aspect that is immediately palpable...The first few minutes of the film consist of Morris being brought by boat to Alcatraz, inspected by a doctor and thrown into a cell... Throughout this, Eastwood does not speak... But already the audience feels it... They know the character... He has been through this before... He tries to control his mind... He builds a barrier between himself and his surroundings... He holds back his fear but he's not so foolish as to appear brave... Behind his impassivity, his mind is calculating... He is studying everyone... Everyone knows, prison guards and fellow prisoners alike, that this is not a man to be intimidated with easily...But Siegel wasn't making a film about penal cruelty or miscarriage of justice or anything like that... He was presenting a meditative study of the inflexibility of human spirit, with a star strong enough in himself to join one sequence to the next... Both Siegel and Eastwood are known for violence, but there's relatively little of it this time...This is not to say that Siegel has no interest in character... Stereotype characters, such as Doc and Litmus, make the film more entertaining... A further example is the inevitable homosexual Wolf (Bruce M. Fisher), who points out that Morris is a potential victim but realizes he has met his match when he approaches him in the showers one morning and gets three unexpected blows in the groin and a bar of soap in the mouth for his harassment... Another familiar type of character is English (Paul Benjamin), the leader of the Black mafia, who sits in the yard far away from the white inmates... English proves to be a nice guy..But the biggest stereotype of them all is the cold warden, although Patrick McGoohan tries as hard as he can to provide Morris with some individual personality... Apart from the flower-crushing and constant attention to his nails, he is permitted by the scriptwriter merely to recite phrases that might have come from the prison handbook: 'No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz alive. Alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket. I was specially chosen to make sure the stink from that basket doesn't escape.'But two elements in the film are absolutely real: one is the central character, which will be considered in a moment, and the other is 'The Rock' itself...Siegel's overwhelming achievement is to send the audience to infamous prison for two hours... The claustrophobia, the implicit suppression of any joy, the barbarity of being caged in isolation cells, all these suffocating atrocities come across with such reality that one experiences a total sense of relief when the camera moves into the recreation yard for the clear bright light of every early morning... Siegel's technique in this respect is unique...Siegel's film style seems almost a cinematic interpretation of Eastwood screen persona: lean, clean, and harsh... Here is one example: When the incorrigible psychopath is out to finish Eastwood, his one chance is in the exercise yard... When he enters the yard, he is in need for a weapon... He has none! He slowly advances into the yard toward his victim... The camera goes down to the man's right hand as he walks... After a moment, another man puts a knife in that hand... The camera stays on the hand as he keeps moving... After another moment, another hand reaches in and grabs the con's arm.... The whole brief sequence is loaded with surprise and suspense... It is in two words: pure cinema...Siegel's movie follows the known facts of the escape constantly, permitting itself only one act of poetic license at the very end... Throughout the film, Siegel uses a yellow chrysanthemum as a symbol of 'heart', to indicate that although the brutal system may have removed everything from the inmates save the questionable privilege of remaining alive, in some men at least their spirit survives... 'Doc', an elderly inmate who has spent twenty years there but who is permitted to paint and cultivate chrysanthemums, introduces the concept...\",\n",
       " \"Alcatraz was America's toughest high-security prison, and has been much beloved by film-makers since it closed and became available as a set. Don Siegel's film is based on the true story of an attempted escape. Some aspects are clich\\\\u00e9d (the psychopathic homosexual, for example) and by concentrating on the brutality of the regime the film gets you on the side of the escapees at the price of suggesting that prison break-outs are actually a good thing. But in general, this is a successful film that has aged well, with no sickly sentiment or overdone melodrama; by concentrating on the unadorned details of the story, the film allows each one to count. A strong, uncompromising movie, gripping even if you know the ending before it starts.\",\n",

He\\'s a little young (9) for a lot of the themes in it, but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that end is ironic.

I finally remembered a few weeks ago how I wanted to see the three movies, so I just watched Mad Max and I have to say that I understand it\\'s cult following. Mad Max promises and delivers, it\\'s a low budget action film, but has a terrific story and excellent stunts.

This was in 1984 I watched the TV listings in England for 20 years waiting for a repeat - finally buying the DVD in 2004, though I couldn't really afford it. Proof that a SCI-FI film does not need tons of effects to work. In a science fiction film book I read years ago they rated Stalker as the only film ever made deserving full marks in all 3 sections.

       " 'Let me start by telling the reader that regardless of what you might have been told, this film is neither cyberpunk or dystopian(unless you consider the USSR in the 70s a dystopia in its own right).I have heard that the film is based on the Strugatski brothers\\' story \\\\\"roadside picnic\\\\\". I can offer no opinion on this piece of literature as I have not been able to get hold of a copy, except to say that the work of theirs which I have read is all solid, consistent SF. The Strugatskis also wrote the screenplay for this, which surprised me.As this film was banned in my country(Reason being \\'glorification of communism\\', which is a joke), and seems not to have ever been released after the unbanning, I watched it on the Internet. I am sorry I blew a lot of data on a film of such low merit.First, the film is inordinately long-winded for the story it has to tell. Certain narrations and self-indulgent bits of cinematography could have been cut without harming the look of the film and tightening the storyline considerably.The conceit of shooting urban sequences in monochrome and the parts happening in the \\\\\"zone\\\\\" in colour is utterly pointless and adds little but confusion.Shortly, the story concerns three people.Introduced first is \\\\\"the stalker\\\\\", a tolkach(Soviet Russia: person who does illegal or borderline illegal free market transactions for which there is a demand). This gentleman\\'s speciality is escorting people into the aforementioned \\\\\"zone\\\\\", within which a room is found which has the power of granting the deepest desires of those who enter(according to rumour, which the stalker obviously does nothing to dispel).Said stalker lives with his wife and daughter in an extremely dilapidated set of rooms which is open to the elements and situated next to the railway, whose trains shake it about. Later we hear that he has no real work and has been in prison several times for penetrating the \\\\\"zone\\\\\", and that his child is malformed due to the zone\\'s action.His two customers, the \\\\\"writer\\\\\" and \\\\\"professor\\\\\" arrive. The writer is an alcoholic and the professor an academic nonentity.After much palaver the three set off into the zone. evading the police barricade. Apparently the zone has aspects of intelligence, killing people who disturb it excessively. The \\\\\"correct\\\\\" route to the room also keeps changing.The trip through the zone is the weakest part of the film. Although the two customers keep messing around, nothing happens to them and the \\\\\"professor\\\\\" even manages to find a short cut by ignoring orders.The \\\\\"writer\\\\\" and \\\\\"professor\\\\\"(who detest each other) indulge in endless disquisitions on the purpose and nature of life, with the stalker joining in on the pseudophilosophical talk by perpetually alluding to religious themes, quoting the Bible, and minutely discussing the fate of another stalker called Porcupine, who got rich by using the room and later hanged himself.A ridiculous scene before the three discuss entering the room shows the professor calling his boss and insulting him, and the writer turning on the lights, showing the long-abandoned zone to have power and telephones working, which is almost impossible.The professor decided to blow up the room because it will attract dangerous types of people. Eventually he changes his mind and dismantles his A-bomb. The writer has decided that the deepest desires of people are debased and refuses to enter (The case of Porcupine is used as an example). Both insult the stalker, saying that he is addicted to playing God and uses the Zone and his clients for the purpose.Although the religious talk may have been very transgressive in 1979 Moscow, it is dated and boring now. ( A film about the rise and fall of Porcupine would have been more interesting.) This film preaches at you, it does not show you, and that is its failing.Positive points are the accurate depiction of a Pripyat-like area six years before Chernobyl, and for showing the living conditions of the most benighted class of people in the USSR(former prisoners).Recommended for fans of religious cinematography and the Turkish dross propaganda film \\\\\"Kod Adi KOZ\\\\\", which it is far better than.',\n",

       " 'Released in a badly cut version in 1979 just before the resurgent interest in Burt Lancaster for his performance in \\\\\"Atlantic City and Peter O\\'Toole for \\\\\"Stunt Man\\\\\", this fine historical epic died an ignominious death at the box office, on the second half of a double bill with the horror film \\\\\"Silent Scream\\\\\". It was originally planned by Cy Endfield as a companion film to his 1964 classic, \\\\\"Zulu\\\\\". That film opened with a voice over of Richard Burton speaking Lord Chelmsford\\'s communication to Prime Minister Disraeli detailing the massacre that befell a British column of about 1,800 British Infantrymen and native contingents at the hands of Zulu warriors at Isandlwana on January 22, 1879. This disaster left the 155 men at the mission post at Rorke\\'s Drift to fend for themselves against several thousand Zulu warriors headed their way. \\\\\"Zulu Dawn\\\\\" chronicles the chain of events that led up to the British debacle at Isandlwana, the worst defeat ever suffered by a professional army at the hands of native forces in history.Director Douglas Hickox keeps the film moving along and the film is an excellent example of adapting historical events to the needs of cinematic form and drama. In a little less than two hours the causes for the war as well as the roots of the disaster are laid out in clear, if simplified terms. The arrogance of the British Empire as personified by Sir Henry Bartle Frere, (John Mills in another stiff upper lip performance) and his chief lieutenant, Frederick Theisger, Lord Chelmsford, (Peter O\\'Toole, nicely understated and subdued) are in the filmmaker\\'s view clearly responsible for a war that need never have been fought at all. The film also makes clear that Sir Henry initiated the conflict without the knowledge let alone consent of the British Government. But the arrogance and sense of entitlement that blinds Sir Henry to dealing with the Zulu in a just and legal manner affects all the participants involved, from the highest government official to the lowest private. It is the mistaken belief that technology, (exemplified here by rockets, cannons and rifles) somehow gives nations the right to take by force whatever they want. Handing Chelmsford his orders, Sir Henry asks, \\\\\"Does this cover, Frederick what we both know to be right?\\\\\" \\\\\"Most excellently, Sir Henry.\\\\\" He replies. It is as if they both need spoken confirmation that the crime they are about to commit is in fact justified.This English disdain is not just reserved for the Zulu, but for fellow countrymen as well. After Col. Hamilton-Brown, robustly played by Nigel Davenport refuses his table in order to be with his men still on the march, Chelmsford contemptuously warns his aide-de-camp, Lt. Hartford, sensitively played by Ronald Pickup to, \\\\\"Learn nothing from that Irishman, except how not to behave.\\\\\" But his real distaste is reserved for Col. Anthony Durnford, a rough-hewn Irishman who has a way with the native troops. With his understanding of the Zulu warrior and his knowledge of the topography, Durnford would obviously be of great use in the coming campaign, but almost immediately there is tension between the two men. And with Burt Lancaster as Durnford it is easy to see why Chelmsford might feel threatened. Even with the use of only one arm, he is a natural leader of men, intelligent and charismatic and unlike Chelmsford he respects the Zulu. It is one of Lancaster\\'s sage portrayals and this time he sports an Irish accent. Dialects were never one of his strong points and this one doesn\\'t completely convince, but it is consistent and it underscores Durnford\\'s isolation among the English who make up most of Chelmsford\\'s staff. More importantly, even at 65, Lancaster has a bravado and dash which makes it understandable how he might warm the heart of beautiful young woman. Fanny Colenso so loved the older Durnford that she went on a one woman crusade to clear his name when the official inquiry into the disaster attempted to shift the blame for it onto him.A great cast is well used in many telling vignettes. Denholm Elliot as the gentle Col. Pulliene has a moving death scene. Simon Ward as William Vereker represents what is best of the British aristocracy abroad and he quickly becomes disenchanted with the war, (\\\\\"A very dirty business, indeed.\\\\\") Michael Jayston as Col. Crealock, Chelmsford\\'s secretary catches all the charm and tact needed for that difficult position. Freddie Jones and Anna Calder-Marshall as Bishop Colenso and his daughter Fanny, having lived among the Zulu are righteously indignant at the prospect of war. Ronald Lacey as Correspondent Norris Newman delights in skewering the official lies about the war. Peter Vaughn as Quartermaster Bloomfield, whose obsession in accounting for every cartridge and shell would have such horrific consequences is marvelous. Simon Sabela makes a very impressive King Cetshwayo in one of the opening sequences to the film and Bob Hoskins as tough Sergeant Major Williams is a lot of fun. With great battle scenes and a rousing score by Elmer Bernstein, \\\\\"Zulu Dawn\\\\\" is a worthy companion to \\\\\"Zulu\\\\\".',\n",

From the opening scene to history repeating (almost) itself at the end, it is well-crafted, says a lot and leaves the viewer changed.  When the voice-over at the end says that the only glory in war is surviving, you KNOW why.

       " 'The Blue Lagoon (1980) is so very close to the book, Blue Lagoon: A Romance, written in 1907 by H. de Vere Stacpoole and published in January 1908.  The actual book is on the Internet and the dialog in the movie is faithful to the book.  Some dismiss the movie as trivial.  However, consider this.  Brooke Christa Shields was 14 years old (born 1966) when she played Emmeline LeStrange. She had already appeared in 12 prior films.  Christopher Atkins was making his movie debut at the age of 18 years (born 1962) playing Emmeline\\'s cousin, Richard LeStrange (referred in the book by the diminutive name, Dicky LeStrange).  In the book, Emmeline is 8 years old and Dicky is 8 years \\\\\"and a bit\\\\\" when the story starts.  Emmeline\\'s father died before she was born.  Two years later her mother died.  Her uncle and father\\'s brother, Arthur LeStrange, (veteran actor William Daniels) took guardianship of Emmeline in Boston.  Mr. LeStrange purchased a small estate in Los Angeles and was in route by clipper ship to San Francisco around South America.  The ship, named Northcumberland, had departed from New Orleans bound for San Francisco.  Having rounded the Cape of South America and going off course during a calm, a fire breaks out in the hull of the ship. The cook, Paddy Button, played expertly by veteran Australian actor Leo McKern took Emmeline and Dicky aboard a dinghy launch and attempted to row a safe distance away from the ship before it exploded from gunpowder stored on board.  Mr. LeStrange and ships\\' compliment were separated in the fog from Paddy, Emmeline, and Dicky after the ship blew up.  Mr. Button and the children drifted in the South Pacific Ocean for about three days and nights until they were brought by the tide to an island named in the book as Palm Tree Island somewhere in the ocean southeast of the Marquesas Islands.  In the movie we see a Boston newspaper with a date that appears to be 1893 floating in the water.  The children and Paddy Button are saved and set up housekeeping as shipwrecked survivors.  For the first 45 minutes of the movie, child actors Elva Josephson and Glenn Kohan play Emmeline and Dicky.  Elva only acted in three movies and two TV appearances while Glenn appeared in this film only and acted no more.  However, they did a good job playing themselves as eight-year-olds.  On the island Paddy tries to be father and mother to the children.  He teaches them the basics of survival, gathering fresh water, harvesting bananas from trees, catching fresh ocean fish, capturing small rabbits, knot tying, hut building, making a signal fire, making a tree calendar to mark the days, and exploring the flora and fauna and caves of the island.  They had rescued a trunk of clothes that the children use as dress up and play items.  Also, there were three-dimension view photos of the day of adults in social activities.  These photos would be useful to educate Emmeline and Dicky in some social graces of civilized people. \\\\nEmmeline had found a keg of rum and a skeleton of another shipwrecked sailor when they first arrived on the island.  After two years on the island, Paddy, drinks himself to death.  It is curious that this small keg would have lasted for two years being the rummy that Paddy was as he tells the children that he has many children in ports around the world.  However, the children discover Paddy\\'s dead body and conduct a burial ceremony as best as they could.  Don\\'t look for this on the TBS \\\\\"edited for content\\\\\" version, as it\\'s not there.  TBS spoils the movie by cutting out what they feel are \\\\\"sensitive\\\\\" parts of the movie, albeit, necessary for continuity of the story to retain its TV 14 rating.  (This is not a children\\'s movie.  This is a young adult\\'s movie.  The rudimentary scenes are necessary to be faithful to the book!  If the rating ends up being \\\\\"R\\\\\", so be it.  Also, this is far from being a \\\\\"soft porn\\\\\" movie as some reviewers suggest.  This is a story about how people can survive in the late 1800s on a deserted South Pacific Island without the niceties of the then civilized western world.)Enter teens Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins at about the age of 14 years.  The story picks up as the children have entered into puberty. Brooke (Emmeline) begins to become aware of her changing body turning her into a woman and she experiences these changes alone and confused without another woman to help educate her.  Likewise, Chris (Dicky) is becoming a man and Brooke, although the same age in the story is more mature than Chris and is becoming sexually attracted to Chris\\' emerging manhood.  What was once child\\'s play and tickle-touch between children, is now, sexually sensitive to young emerging teens.  Critics -- this is Nature at work!  The moviemakers did a wonderful job of portraying this on film. \\\\nOf course, they discover sex.  But, they do not know that it produces children.  Emmeline and Dicky marry each other in a ceremony they devise to show that they are \\\\\"civilized.\\\\\"  They begin to live together as husband and wife.  Ultimately, Emmeline becomes pregnant and finally is aware that there is something growing within her.  Fast forward to the \\\\\"Bogeymen\\\\\" on the other side of the island.  A tribe of natives had, from time to time, come by boat to the other side of the island.  Here they had a stone idol and sacrificial alter.  At least six times during the film, even when Paddy was still alive, the survivors heard distant drumbeats.  Paddy knew the danger and passed a \\\\\"law\\\\\" warning the children never to go to the other side of the island.  After Paddy\\'s death, Emmeline and Dicky do go to the other side and discover the idol.  Emmeline thinks it is God.  The edited version leaves out the night spying and confrontation of Dicky with a native.  Get the full version for this \\\\\"humane\\\\\" meeting of East meets West.  Oh, these are not African peoples. This is a South Pacific movie.  The natives are supposed to be \\\\\"Polynesians.\\\\\"In the book, Emmeline has her child all alone on the floor of the forest while Dicky is returning from spying on the Natives.  In the movie, Dicky returns, \\\\\"in the nick of time,\\\\\" to witness the child\\'s birth.  No matter. That\\'s Hollywood\\'s movie license.Of course, Uncle Richard has continued to pursue finding his son and niece. The book explains how he comes to know where the children might be.  He hires a ship to search the area of the Palm Tree Island.  Ultimately, Emmeline, Dicky, and baby Paddy (now about 2 years old  -- in the book she names the boy child a girls name, Hannah because she likes the name) put out to sea in the dinghy that is still seaworthy after being shipwrecked for eight years and five months.  After losing their oars during a shark attack, the survivors, without food or water, drift in the ocean for three days before Uncle Richard discovers them.  The movie ends as faithful to the book ending.  The trio is rescued.  When the rescue boat rows out to intercept the dinghy, Mr. LeStrange asks, \\\\\"Are they dead?\\\\\"  The ship\\'s crewman replies, \\\\\"No, they\\'re asleep.\\\\\"Beautiful Brooke and handsome Chris are not to be made fun of.   They acted remarkably well portraying children with limited education and vocabulary. The island scenery is beautifully photographed.  There is a wonderful special effect when Brooke baths in the ocean.  Get the video as TBS took a hatchet to these frames.  If you were living in that era and shipwrecked and survived, you would want your eight plus years on the island to be like Brooke and Chris spent in this film.  Get the video and enjoy.  It\\'s an adult film for mature teens and older adults.',\n",

De Palma\\'s love of complex camera-work and luscious, blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma\\'s wife at the time) and Michael Caine make every scene special.

It is proud of its directness and not ashamed of being over the top.What really matters here, is the journey, not the destination. Ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality, will never realize that 'Fame' is about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not about their careers.Ironically enough, none of the very talented actors of 'Fame' made it in Hollywood. 'Fame' marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness.

       " \"I saw this film before I joined the Navy and again before I served on Nimitz (CVN 68). Kind of a nice feather in my cap experiencing the world's largest 'time machine' in person! On to the movie... A very interesting premise which should have merited a more detailed analysis! Executed well enough for 1980, but could be remade into one hell of a motion picture today! I'd love to see it. One thing the story does well is get one thinking about the 'what-if' scenario having the most modern carrier in the today's fleet taking on the Japanese Navy almost 40 years prior... Hmm. What a mismatch that would be in much the same way that **** SPOILER ALERT **** Combat Air Patrol (CAP) Tomcats rendered the 'Zeroes ' splashed handily! But, the very nature of Paradoxes would have rendered intervention potentially destructive to Nimitz and all aboard! (Which would have made profound changes to MY naval career as well.) And that was the dilemma faced; Do we change history because we feel a conscious duty to tilt the war in our favor (At least in the short term.)? Or do we choose to let nature take its course knowing full well the outcome if nothing is done? 4 more years of war and millions of lives? Or win a decisive victory and save all of the agony yet to come at the possible expense of destroying the fabric of space/time... or at the very least causing the U.S. and the Allies to lose in the long run because the U.S. would have delayed entering the war? Thorny, eh? As it turns out, history in this film was changed in a minor way but then again... was it? Possible predestination paradox, meaning events were supposed to happen the way they did. ***SPOILER ALERT*** If the Nimitz had stayed to fight, logistically it would have been possible... for a short time. Without access to spare parts, jet fuel and other means of support, the ship would have been nearly useless. True, this vessel class can steam for over 20 years on a fresh set of plutonium rods, but jets can't fly without fuel or spare parts! And just imagine trying to provision that ship with its crew of 5000 plus with 1940's technology! This ignores what the U.S. Government would have done once they got their hands on Nimitz and her technology back then! The debriefing would never end for those people! And imagine the changes to history then! (Could be a whole other movie!) All in all, I think it was a great piece of science fiction and a very enjoyable 'what if'... I recommend anyone see it who can! It has its flaws and is dated but the concept is still very valid. The movie's big strength is not so much what is said, but what is not. The important stuff is left to the viewer's imagination, and this is what makes it very entertaining and provocative! This is the movie that made the USS Nimitz a household word and I am very proud to have served on a piece of science fiction history (no pun intended)! The ship is very distinguished and far more impressive 'in the steel' than she is on film. I give this film a 7.9/10. Mostly for the powerful premise.\",\n",
       " \"This was a highly entertaining sleeper about a naval ship that happens to go through a time warp and end up at Pearl Harbor just hours before the attack in 1941. Realistic acting, special effects and air scenes really make this movie stand out from other similar movies. I'm really surprised that this film is not more popular, because this was a very unique and fascinating concept for a movie, especially back in 1980. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good science-fiction film. I'm also surprised that it has such a low rating, I was expecting it to be rated at least a 7. Ill give it an 8 out of 10. Well worth viewing.\",\n",

Some of the best movies take one or two freak things and then play them out absolutely straight (e.g., Big, Back to the Future, Groundhog Day). Modern aircraft carrier encounters bizarre storm and finds itself between the Japanese fleet and Pearl Harbor a day before the infamous attack. What to do, what to do... What happens (which isn't actually much) takes a back seat to 1) an Oscar-caliber performance by Kirk Douglas as ship captain, and also fine performances by Sheen, Durning and others; and 2) the wonder of tactical operations on a modern carrier. For war buffs just the idea of the U.S.S. Nimitz prowling near the Jap fleet with Douglas at the helm is enough. Enchanting musical score and satisfying wrap. 10 out of 10\",\n",
       " \"An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema.\",\n",

I was rather embarrassed by the fact that I had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics. Instead of the masterpiece I was promised however , I was left with a great mediocrity. The characters were barely 2 dimensional , the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy . Episode V was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isn't close to being good.

       " 'There are films out there that can be described as a guilty pleasure - you know they\\'re quite bad, but somewhere deep down in your heart you can\\'t bring yourself to admit it. Flash Gordon is, in my opinion, the guiltiest pleasure of them all. Cardboard characters, lunatic script, embarrassing dialogue, trashy performances (apart from Max Von Sydow), and hilarious special effects... yet the one thing that comes out in the film\\'s favour is that, despite its seemingly countless faults, it is still irresistibly entertaining.American football legend Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) and sexy babe Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) are aboard a private flight when a weird red-storm forces them to perform an emergency landing. They crash into the back garden of wacky ex-NASA scientist Hans Zarkov (Topol), an eccentric madman who believes the world is under attack from alien forces and who has built his own spaceship to do battle with the enemy. Astonishingly, it turns out that Zarkov was right - and pretty soon, Flash, Dale and Zarkov find themselves on the planet Mongo, battling against its tyrannical emperor Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow), with a little help from Ming\\'s treacherous daughter (Ornella Muti), her lover Barin (Timothy Dalton), and the winged warrior Vultan (Brian Blessed).Flash Gordon is an absolutely insane film. The set design is remarkable, as is the costume design, and a pounding rock soundtrack is provided by the group Queen. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Von Sydow somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously sinister edge. Some of the dialogue is so awful that it becomes eminently quotable by virtue of its badness (a few samples: \\\\\"This Ming is a psycho!\\\\\"; \\\\\"That must be some planet you come from!\\\\\"; and - my favourite - \\\\\"Freeze! You bloody bastards!\\\\\") Flash Gordon should be a total disaster - an awful shambles of a film with no redeeming qualities. It isn\\'t. Perhaps we\\'ll never know how or why it works, but it does.

       " 'I saw Heaven\\'s Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino\\'s long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece \\\\\"The Deerhunter.\\\\\" The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business. The film at that time cost about 40 million dollars (now considered low budget) making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film. \\\\\"The Deerhunter\\\\\" had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias building up against Cimino.                        At the time I thought the film was very good and when I saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so. The film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990\\'s. They were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print. Nevertheless, seeing the film years later I now thought Heaven\\'s Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version started to appear in a few select cities, I got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait. Heaven\\'s Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on. Despite the mandate Joseph Cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club. The film flashes ahead 20 years to Johnson County in Wyoming. A cattle company called \\\\\"the Stockholders Association\\\\\" has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson sides with the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it.                             A massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves. A United States Cavalry comes to the rescue of the Association  to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his Harvard days married, bored, on a yacht, living but dead on the inside.This is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it\\'s themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set designs, and acting.   Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston, and Cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters. Some of the major complaints I read about this film state that is ugly to look at, incoherent, too long, that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible.             In its defense, Heaven\\'s Gate has the look of photographs of that period just as \\\\\"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\\\\\" did. Some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality.(The critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot.) But in spite of all that, the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable.                                                     The film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it.  Everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes. As to its length, it is a beautifully structured piece,  at times moving, poetic, exhilarating, or devastating with virtually one great scene following another. At times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity. But one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language, the glances between characters or their actions. One day soon this film should be re-released in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles- under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the  kinds of great films he is capable of making.',\n",

At first, Conrad tells Dr. Berger he wants to gain control but what he really wants is to not feel - not feel the pain of his brother\\'s death and what he believes is his part in it. But that unravels through a series of experiences he endures as the movie proceeds. In choir practice, Conrad is smitten with Jeannine Pratt (beautifully played by Elizabeth McGovern), a fellow singer who has an ability to recognize Conrad\\'s pain without being amazed, horrified or judgmental. And Conrad also has a friend, Karen, (played nicely by Dinah Manoff)whom he\\'d met in the hospital and who can relate to his experiences there.Donald Sutherland as Cal, Mary Tyler Moore as Beth and Timothy Hutton as Conrad give outstanding, Oscar-caliber performances. Cal tries to keep his feelings hidden by wearing a mask of bravado, carrying on and functioning in a world that has taken his son away. He loves Conrad and also recognizes his pain and his alienation fom his mother though he realizes he can\\'t \\\\\"fix it.\\\\\" But it\\'s Mary Tyler Moore\\'s performance as Beth that is so amazing. She is plastic through and through and it gets to the point of being downright annoying and yet MTM\\'s portrayal is perfect. Of all the characters, hers is really the most disturbed. She wants to have things exactly as they were even though she mourns the loss of her firstborn son. She can\\'t love Conrad because he committed the one unforgivable sin - he survived while her favorite did not.Timothy Hutton, sadly, has never had a movie to top \\\\\"Ordinary People.\\\\\" He has done other work, of course, (most notably in my opinion, \\\\\"Taps\\\\\") and can be seen currently as Archie in \\\\\"Nero Wolf\\\\\" on A&amp;E. But his role as the troubled surviving son who rises from the pain in \\\\\"Ordinary People\\\\\" is truly magnificent and shattering. He earned the Oscar and he truly deserved it. And as he accepted his Academy Award, he remembered his father, actor Jim Hutton, who had died from liver cancer shortly before Timothy got the award. That was a classy thing to do. I hope Mr. Hutton gets another plum role like this one; everything else he has done since pales in comparison.',\n",
       " 'What\\'s with all the bashing? I never get tired of watching this warm, visceral musical that pulls me in with its myriad textures, striking colors, and unpredictable pacing and dialogue which never seems contrived or scripted (and of course was often expertly improvised). It is the unfettered antithesis to all the shiny, over-produced media of our age. No pretty faces. No product placements. No feel of a commercialized film crafted to be anything other than a comedy musical adaptation of one of my favorite comic strips. It adapts the world of E.C. Daily\\'s style, before King Features \\\\\"cleaned it up\\\\\" for animation. Disjointed, rambling...borderline insane, just like the comic! And the music is bonus all the way through. Quirky, playful, simple numbers that perfectly reflect the feel of the old comic. But then again, I liked Hudson Hawk and the Forbidden Zone, so you probably don\\'t want to listen to me.

It starts off with young (17 year old to 25 year old) who have been filled with propaganda about the war effort and glorious battle. After this young crew of immature sailors start to experience the true horrors of war, you can not only see, but experience with them the boredom, laughter, camaraderie, team work and death. In a world where you have no windows, where your ears have to be your eyes, where a cat and mouse game is played and the looser dies, these young men age 10 to 15 years It makes the viewer realize the horror of submarine warfare in WWII.

A good movie that would've been better had not Hollywood made so many fine films on the same subject in the 40 or so years preceding Das Boot.

I'm particularly reminded of THE ENEMY BELOW (1957), a superb drama on some of the same subject matter.

Good acting and story do, period.The movie of course is based on the Greek myth of Perseus. It follows the original myth rather well but of course there was some artistic license taken.

Only part of the movie that i weren't content about was the childhood of conan, the part where he grows up spinning some goddamn wheel of fortune, Howard specifically points in many novels that Conan was grown free in the Cimmeria.

My only sadness is that Paul Geoffrey and Nigel Terry, two of the main character actors, seem not to have become such household names.

I am a big fan of the actress and I love her to death in Friday the 13th Part 2. This movie is my number 4 favorite slasher Friday the 13th film in the series and I love Amy Steel so damn much as Ginny Field! She was the best heroine in the slasher films in my opinion. I love this film to death and I enjoy it and love it the same as the first one I love the atmosphere in the film. It has the best kills in the series. Characters are fairly well-developed and likable, at least for this franchise, and there are plenty of thrills. One of the most memorable final shocks rounds everything out.It is Jason Voorhees first outing as the murderer and the image of him wearing the potato sack over his head is burned into my retinas as one of the most memorable in the franchise.Amy Steel is a brilliant addition to the cast, a great heroine I love her to death in \\\\\"Friday The 13th part 2\\\\\" and I also love her in April Fool\\'s Day she was excellent in those two films. She is always my favorite lead and I really enjoy Friday the 13th Part 2 more then the first one.Friday the 13th Part 2 is a great sequel great horror slasher movie that made Jason Voorhees memorial cool horror icon.This time the film was directed and produced by Steve Miner who I thought did an excellent job directing the film. This time for the special makeup effects was Carl Fullerton who did the right job like Tom Savini did with the first one.I love how Amy Steel defend her self against Jason Voorhees who was this time played by actor Steve Daskawisz with a potato sack. Amy Steel used chain saw on Jason that scene was copied by Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning and was also used and copied in Maniac Cop 2 I just didn\\'t like it. Watch the climatic fight between Jason and Ginny in which Ginny imitates Jason\\'s mom Pamela (Betsy Palmer) and then she swings with a machete towards Jason and Jason raises the mattock to block Ginny\\'s machete swing this was an epic Climatic fight in the movie.Ginny Field with working tool fork in the hands is just memorial all over Amy Steel\\'s picture we see her on IMDb and every where.Mrs. Voorhees is dead, and Camp Crystal Lake is shut down, but a camp next to the infamous place is stalked by an unknown assailant.Adrienne King and Walt Gorney did return that was a surprise for me and the were the first characters to die in the beginning of the film.Adrienne King wanted to reprise her role as Alice, but she said that she wanted to be on screen for a short period of time because there was an obsessive fan who was stalking her, broke into her apartment, and she feared for her life. So I respect the actress and her decision since this film she never return on TV screen but she lend her voice to animation movies. Adrienne King filmed all of her scenes in two days then she run faster as she could.Amy Steel has stated that she found shooting the \\\\\"window scene\\\\\" difficult. The shot required three takes and her frightened reaction is genuine. Because the shot was in slow-motion, a high-speed camera was used, and every time she heard the film start running, she would tense up and get scared. Amy was very upset with the director for the window scene and it was really annoyed cause director keep shouting they have to repeat the scenes.Great horror slasher suspense entertaining 80\\'s movie my all time favorite horror film I still going to watch it. I watched this film 7 years ago when I was a big fan of Supernatural and I heard Jared Padalecki auditioned for his lead role in Friday the 13th reboot and I was curious so I went watching this film alongside with the first original film and Jason X before I watched reboot that was my fourth film I saw.I remember seeing this movie on DVD in the video store when I was in high school. I wasn\\'t interesting seen it that time but today I am glad I have this film on Blu-ray, just got it this Thursday all 11th films and I watch it in Friday 22th this is the 3d time in the row I saw this film and i still will.This is one in my top 5 favorite Friday the 13th films it is my number four favorite slasher Friday the 13th movie and it is the best one.

To get her mind off things, a psychiatrist recommends she goes to his private retreat to be treated. After that, spooky happenings and strange deaths start occurring. This film has great direction and great atmosphere and mood. The lighting and use of fog is excellent and really hightens the spookiness of the film. One of the best werewolf transformations is shown in this film, rivaled only by the one in An American Werewolf in London. Although this movie starts out slow, the tension keeps rising and keeps you interested in what will happen next. The spookiness doesn't always lie within the content but also the claustrophobic feeling and the uncertainty of who you can trust. A very good movie, highly recommended.\",\n",

       " \"'Gallipoli' is the story of two young sprinters who join the war effort in Turkey during World War I.  There have been countless war films in cinema history covering the different wars, the horrors of war, etc.  What is unique about this story is its probing of two young friends and their journey into the military effort--unlike other war films, which deal directly with the war, 90% of this film follows the journey of these two young men before they transfer over to the war.  The special quality of this is that the viewer gets to know these two protagonists very well and their humble lives in Australia--which makes the tragic ending all the more devastating.  The last 20 or 30 minutes of the film is spent at the Gallipoli peninsula, inside the war trenches.  The generals vainly send men running toward the enemy and they are swiftly slaughtered.  These scenes demonstrate the horrible truth of war, that healthy young men with lives ahead of them are destroyed forever in a single, pointless instance.The final minute of the film is truly heartbreaking, as a tragedy occurs between the two young friends.  The very last shot of the film is stunning, as a horrible image is frozen on screen.  Director Weir could have fallen into the sentimentality trap, but he was smart: the tragedy occurs, and the moment it does, the movie ends RIGHT THERE, leaving you with a haunting final image.A landmark war film, highly recommended.\",\n",

       " \"Imagine Bergman's 'Scenes From a Marriage' filmed by Dario Argento using Kubrick's 'Shining' steadicam.  I can't pretend to have actually UNDERSTOOD this intellectually rigorous horror film, but I do know that it is arguably the most beautiful film of the 1980s, that ugliest of cinematic decades. \\\\nThe chief source of this beauty is Zulawski's camerawork, unsettling, spacious, constantly mobile, it achieves the kind of elaborate shots you normally expect with cumbersome, expensive equipment with the nimbleness of a handheld camera.  Static scenes in repetitive milieux are subjected to awesomely complex movements, as the camera encircles, tracks, reveals, blocks, opens up space, creating a narrative that never stands still, offering us different, usually startling viewpoints within the one scene. \\\\nWhat is most remarkable is its transformation of scale - the film is set in Cold-War Berlin, a famously constricted city; the plot takes place mostly in inhumanly modern apartments or on streets, and yet the sense of size, scale, space is as monumental as a Fordian Western.  This is apt for characters who are simultaneously confined and alienated by their environment.  Even scenes of flamboyant repulsiveness, the puling monster mounting Isabella Adjani, Mark's lavatorial dispatch of Heinrich, have a clarity of composition that is simply breathtaking.Unlike most horror films, which open with images of normality against which to measure the transgression of terror, 'Possession' hurls us into its relentless unpleasantness in medias res.  Zulawski opens at full speed and never lets up.  Mark in his car looks out at a city he hasn't seen for some time as if it is an alien land, full of troubling images, including an iron cross.  Anna rushes to meet him.  We assume they are husband and wife, reuniting, but their talk if full of exasperated dislocation.  Mark has apparently come home too early.  They have a son; after making love, their post-coital talk is full of Antonionian misunderstanding, uncertainty, alienation, cruelty.These scenes create the mood of the whole film.  'Possession' is shot in English with a French lead by a Polish director.  The dialogue has a stilted quality, like a translation from some lost original; this sense of not-quite-rightness extends to the acting, and the scenes themselves, which seem too mannered, too abrupt, too stylised to seem natural.  This sense of the drama being at one remove from some original 'reality' is perfect for a film about alienation - people alienated from themselves, each other, their marriage, their home, even their identity.  The horror that constitutes the film obviously has its roots in the female hysteria (one scene in a subway, remembered by Anna, has her miscarry, as she pours out blood and milk, the essence of her femaleness spilling from her; the toilet scene between Heinrich and Mark has a gynaecological terror similar to Argento's 'Suspiria') and male bestiality that cannot be hidden by affluent modernity, but this, on its most basic level, is a harrowing portrait of a failed marriage, horribly truthful to anyone who has even rejoiced in that institution.  All the while we are constantly reminded of the contemporary political reality - Mark's espionage (or is he an assassin?) activities; the wired Berlin wall with its faceless surveillance guards (a divided city, a divided marriage, literally divided people, the whore and the madonna).  The film has a lot of talk about faith, chance, God, good and evil, but its true power is recognisably more mundane, yet more unaccountably wrenching than that.  One should not overlook the comic sense that flickers through the film, the exaggeration of scenes by prolonging them (the restaurant scene), and the Franju-like waltz-of-death music.\",\n",

The story begins on Christmas Eve, and we are plunged right away into a fairytale atmosphere.Fanny and Alexander\\\\\"s family seems a happy one, actually a family of theatre actors. During the Christmas Eve party held at the grandmother\\'s heavily-furnished house, the atmosphere is joyful at first glance, especially for the children who obviously feel very much at home. But reality is not just what it seems. The children\\'s father is seriously ill. One of the uncles is manic-depressive, and the other is a skirt-chaser who has an affair with the young maid while his wife shows a lot of comprehension. Even the grandmother keeps a secret affair with a Jewish banker (played by Erland Josephson, a Bergman regular) that has lasted for many years.The children\\'s world collapse as their father dies. Soon after, their still young and beautiful mother marries the bishop, whose name is Vergerus (that\\'s the name of the villain in all Bergman\\'s movies, don\\'t ask me why). The atmosphere in the bishop\\'s house could not be more different from the children\\'s first home. It is bare, silent, freezing. Alexander and the bishop hate each other from the start. This hate culminates when the bishop flogs Alexander to punish him, during a suffocating scene. War is declared from then on. Although the children\\'s mother is pregnant, she already regrets her second marriage and seeks help from her former family.The grandma\\'s Jewish friend, who is also sort of a magician, manages to kidnap the children by a clever stratagem. They are sheltered in his house, which is full of puppets and mysterious objects. There, a strange nephew of his lives in seclusion (the role is played by a woman). From then on, reality and fantasy get blurred, but what is certain is that the evil bishop meets a cruel fate, and the children\\'s mother finally makes it back to her former home.The film ends as it began, with a party. Two new babies are just born : the mother\\'s baby she had from the wicked bishop, and the maid\\'s baby with the luscious uncle. The two of them are accepted immediately as part of the family, which is a rather precocious sign of Scandinavian open-mindedness (in 1900, illegitimate children were generally rejected as bastards).Despite the title, attention is focused much more on Alexander than on Fanny. She is there all the time but speaks little, while showing unconditional solidarity with her brother. A possible reason is that the movie seems to have strong autobiographical elements, more than any other Bergman, and if so, Alexander seems to incarnate Bergman himself as a child. Bergman\\'s father happened to be a minister, and the director confessed that he was raised in a very oppressive manner. Thus, it is quite possible that Alexander\\'s step family is a representation of Bergman\\'s real family, while Alexander\\'s real family is the family Bergman had dreamed of, unsurprisingly a family of actors.This film also displays the most accomplished use that Bergman\\'s renowned photographer Sven Nykvist ever made of color. He was a long time reluctant to color and kept shooting in black and white well into the sixties. Bergman\\'s first color movies had nothing special, until \\\\\"Cries and whispers\\\\\" where an obsessive use of red started to appear. The color contrasts are very strong in \\\\\"Fanny and Alexander\\\\\", and are especially used to underline the difference between the grandmother\\'s colorful home and the bishop\\'s house which is mostly all black and white.There are many characters in this story, and all the major adult roles are played by actors who are all very famous in Sweden. There is a special appearance by Harriet Andersson, who played the female lead in many Bergmans of the fifties, especially well remembered as the whimsical \\\\\"Monika\\\\\". Here, she is ungratefully cast as the bishop\\'s elderly tormented servant who likes scaring the children with horror stories. As for the young maid, she is played Pernilla Wallgren, who married Danish director Bille August and became later famous as Pernilla August. She played the lead in \\\\\"The best intentions\\\\\" directed by Bille August but based on a script by Bergman, and also taking place in Uppsala at the turn of the twentieth century...',\n",

People are real nasty to him. Especially the deputy with the moustache. He was a real jerk. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense. I highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric.

The episode, Space Seed, introduced Kahn Noonian Singh, a genetically engineered super-warrior from the 20th century who survived in cryogenic freeze until the crew of the Enterprise found his derelict space ship and revived him.  Alas, his instinct to conquer survived as well, and only after an epic struggle is Kirk able to deposit Kahn and his band of supermen in permanent exile on a garden planet.Fifteen years later, a cataclysm has left that planet barren, and Kahn bitter about his plight, when along comes the Enterprise, not knowing they have returned to Kahn's home planet.  Kahn escapes and the game is on.This is undoubtedly the best of the Star Trek movies, and in fact, the best of everything that was best about Star Trek TOS.  There is heroism, epic conflict, a fully satisfying story, and deliciously over the top acting by Shatner, Nimoy and, the main course, Ricardo Montalban, reprising his original role, with all the menace and drama of, say, Sir Anthony Hopkins' Oscar winning turn as Hannibal Lechter.The writing is great, and why not, it was by Harve Bennett, by way of Melville, and Roddenberry's unforgettable characters, as indelibly etched on our psyches as any fairy tale of our youth, were never brighter, more heroic, more magnificent.  In the genre, there is simply nothing better, and there never will be.  It took decades to hone and refine these characters, for us to come to love them, and for them to reach the point in their palpably real lives to reflect with self-doubt and angst on lives that we accept as being as real as our own.

Carpenter's version is slow, talky, dull, and punctuated only by over-the-top silliness that shows his puerile obsession with gore-puppets. The 'paranoia' of people who may not be who they seem plays much better in 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or 'Planet of the Vampires,' or even in Campbell's own story.

Some details of the novel are only hinted at or cut out entirely (Johnny\\'s mother\\'s religious delusion, his first accident on the ice, the Wheel Of Fortune, etc), but compromises have to be made when turning a book with 500 pages into a feature length movie and I think the right editing choices have been made.\\\\\"The Dead Zone\\\\\" is not only an overlooked gem when it comes to Stephen King adaptations, it\\'s also one of Cronenberg\\'s best directing jobs, not very typical of his work, but pretty timeless. Sure, nowadays the accident at the beginning, Johnny\\'s visions and the shootout at the end would be made more gripping and spectacular, but those minor flaws don\\'t really make the movie seem all that dated.Of course, having read the book I enjoyed the movie as a portrayal of events I had pictured in my mind before. I don\\'t know, if \\\\\"The Dead Zone\\\\\" is thrilling to first time viewers, too, since the plot leaps a little, being a series of episodes rather than one continuous story.

Some may even say that it\\'s a sequel in sorts.Rupert Pupkin (De Niro) is a lonely man whose daily life and routines consist around one man: Jerry Langston, a talk show host and comedian who is followed by a horde of rabid fans, including Masha (Sandra Bernhard), a fan to rival Pupkin, who admits that he has waited nine hours at a time outside Jerry\\'s recording studio to catch a glimpse of him as he is shoved into limos by fancy bodyguards.Rupert is given a rare opportunity to speak to Jerry one day as he saves him from Masha, who assaulted Jerry with kisses and hugs. It is as they drive away together and Rupert talks to Jerry that he proposes his long-time dream, which is to appear on Jerry\\'s show as an aspiring standup comic. Of course, he\\'s had no experience. But Rupert swears he would be great on stage -- he\\'s studied Jerry for years and knows timing.Langston gets these psychos all the time, but he doesn\\'t realize just how strong a fan Rupert is until he shows up at his private home with suitcases and a girl claiming to have been invited. \\\\\"I made a mistake,\\\\\" Rupert says. \\\\\"So did Hitler,\\\\\" Jerry barks.Jerry Lewis plays Jerry Langston in a self-referential (and very unflattering) role. It\\'s his finest to date. The guy is a scumbag who barely tolerates fans and is cruel. Lewis has lost his manic, energetic, annoying comedy rituals seen in films such as \\\\\"The Nutty Professor\\\\\" and has moved on to real acting that demands true skill. Gone are the squeaky voice and the crossed eyes. Here is perhaps the wretched soul who really exists behind Jerry Lewis, as we know him.All of us exaggerate, but Rupert does so to an extreme. After being shoved out of Jerry\\'s limo the night of their confrontation with an invitation to call Jerry\\'s secretary to schedule a meeting, Rupert shows up at Jerry\\'s office claiming to have an appointment. \\\\\"Is Jerry expecting you?\\\\\" he is asked by a clerk. \\\\\"Yes, I don\\'t think so,\\\\\" Rupert says.Jerry and his workers, who deny his taped comedy routine that we never hear until the end, shun Rupert. \\\\\"Oh, I see, this is what happens to people like you from all of this!\\\\\" Rupert yells at Jerry. \\\\\"No,\\\\\" he replies. \\\\\"I\\'ve always been like this.\\\\\"So Rupert breaks down and kidnaps Jerry with the help of Masha, demanding a spot on his TV show as a ransom payment. He commands that he will be referenced to as \\\\\"The King of Comedy\\\\\" (hence the title), and to further demonstrate the innocence of Rupert\\'s character, when he shows up, he fails to see the gravity of the offence he has just committed.\\\\nRupert is twisted, as you may have guessed by now, but not in a Travis Bickle kind of way. He doesn\\'t see the bad in the world -- he\\'s oblivious to it. \\\\\"You\\'re so naive!\\\\\" Masha tells him. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if he took it as a compliment.Rupert lives in complete isolation, kept locked up with his mother and living his life by what he says on TV. His dialogue and mannerisms are all clich\\\\u00e9d -- he says the kind of stuff one would expect a poorly written film to feature. When he tries to impress a female bartender, and when he tries to make small talk with Jerry, he frightens both individuals (similar to Travis Bickle frightening Senator Palantine and the Secret Service Agent).As Rupert takes the stage at the end of the film, his entire dreams have been laid forth in front of him and he takes them by the throat. It is in that truly startling moment we\\'ve all been waiting for when we learn that Rupert is not only funny, but pretty darn talented. If the movie had used Rupert\\'s life-long dreams as the butt end of a joke, if he had turned out to be an absolutely horrid comedian (which is what I honestly thought would happen), the film would have little effect. But as a filmgoer and critic, it ranks as one of the most surprising scenes I have ever laid eyes on.\\\\n5/5 stars.John Ulmer',\n",
       " \"A welcome assault on the senses, 'Koyaanisqatsi' is not for the impatient or nervous.  You have to give it time because it is slightly dull in the very beginning, as the music and landscapes are fairly ordinary.  Once it gets going, its really fascinating.  Some gorgeous images, none generated by a computer I might add, and a soundtrack to match the intensity makes this a unique movie experience.  I saw it on the big screen when it was first released, and it was MUCH better than on my not-that-big television.\\\\nOne of the things I also like about this movie is the fact that since there is no dialogue, it can be shown in any country in the world unchanged.  We would all see it the exact same way. I like the idea of that very much.\",\n",

Full of interesting and amusing characters, a terrific musical score, wryly satirical without being demeaning of anyone; it invites you into a totally believable world where you begin to care about the fate of everyone and there are no false notes in the script, direction or performances.If anyone ever doubted the importance of a screenplay in the success of a movie or thought that a big budget, lots of pyrotechnics and loads of special effects could cover up a movie's shortcomings - see this film. It should be required at all film schools as an example of what can be accomplished on a little budget but with good ideas and lots of talent. A perfect 10 - times 2!\",\n",

Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Robert Loggia and Meg Tilly are all great and turn in very good performances. Vera Miles turns in a very eccentric performance, it shows how much she hates Norman. Anthony Perkins makes the viewer feel sorry for him as he slowly becomes confused again. Meg Tilly has a lot of charm and Robert Loggia is very good as the very caring Doctor. It's a well done thrill- ride, highly entertaining and full of suspense, thanks to director Franklin. Well done to every one involved. I think this is the best Psycho sequel. I love it a lot! You'd think that as it is the sequel to the classic Psycho, it would suck, it does not!My personal rating: 10 out of 10.\",\n",
       " 'RISKY BUSINESS is the smart and sexy 1983 teen comedy that brought intelligence to the genre and made a bonafide movie star out of Tom Cruise. Cruise is utterly winning as Joel Goodson, a high school senior excited about the prospect of having the house to himself when his parents go out of town for a few days; but things go from bad to worse when Joel crosses paths with a nubile prostitute (Rebecca DeMornay). This surprise hit brought an element of sophistication that was absent from a lot of the teen comedies that were populating the screen in the 1980\\'s. This movie boasts a smart screenplay, imaginative direction, a memorable musical score, and on-target performances from Cruise, DeMornay, Curtis Armstrong, Joe Pantoliano (memorable as a slimy pimp), Bronson Pinchot, and Janet Carroll.

       " 'I realize that\\'s not saying it\\'s the best ever made, but it certainly marked me so much as to regard it as my all-time fave.The movie reminisces of Elia Kazan\\'s Dean movies, and \\\\\"The Wild One\\\\\" starring Marlon Brando. Just as those movies (and much better done, IMHO), Rumble Fish is about violence as a consequence of uncomprehension; loneliness; and family relations in a sordid, black and white environment. Not even this choice is random, as its B&amp;W filming (and somewhat deficient sound quality) is yet another commentary on life as seen through the eyes of its characters - and author.Every scene in this movie brings a realization, though some of the dialogues are indeed a bit naive when seen after its time. And here I could engage in a debate on \\\\\"naivet\\\\u00e9\\\\\" vs. \\\\\"savvy\\\\\", and whether an innocent view of life really means less message depth (or whether a jaded outlook really guarantees understanding), but I digress. The point is, I\\'m a 27-year old man and I still cry every time I see this movie.The first time I saw Rumble Fish, I thought I identified with the Motorcycle boy and his alienation from the world he was put in. After a few more times, I realized more and more that I \\\\\"was\\\\\" Rusty-James - That, to an extent, EVERY man is a little Rusty-James; trying to live up to a hero image, and helplessly watching as your ideal slips past your reach and lets himself be killed, without you ever understanding anything until it\\'s too late... or is it?Where Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis speak to the hero we WANT to be, Matt Dillon speaks to the MEN who want to be that hero, and leads the way out.*sigh*The astounding soundtrack, exquisite photography and perfect takes don\\'t hurt any, either.Buy it, rent it, whatever.

       " 'Star Wars: Episode VI \\\\u2013 Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don\\'t love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba\\'s men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2\\'s help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan \\\\\"Ben\\\\\" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader\\'s right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son\\'s blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try\\'s to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke\\'s transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don\\'t like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie\\'s biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren\\'t Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don\\'t mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don\\'t remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.',\n",
       " 'Anytime someone asks me what I\\'d consider the scariest movie ever, I say \\\\\"Silkwood,\\\\\" and they say \\\\\"But that\\'s not a horror movie.\\\\\"No?There is so much to fear here, and scariest of all, probably, is the fact that the title character lived just a few decades ago, in modern-day America.There is the fear that comes from living in poverty, or right on the edge of it.  Silkwood, her cohorts, and most of her coworkers have little education; they live humble lives of church revivals, rebuilt cars, and \\\\\"mystery meat\\\\\" sandwiches brought for lunch in brown paper bags.  The nuclear plant where they work is the only game in town (or the entire state), in terms of wages and benefits.  And so, every day, they live in fear of losing their jobs. They have spent their lives being instructed to trust authority and submit to it.  They are intimidated by the managers and supervisors who frown on camaraderie, and positively scowl on their labor union.\\\\nThere is the fear of the unknown at the plant -- trucks being dismantled and buried behind barbed wire, under guard and under cover of darkness. Management gives the workers the minimum amount of information they need to perform their jobs, and often withhold or disguise facts that are essential to their very survival.Karen, a somewhat rebellious, less-than-conscientious worker, is shocked into activism when her co-worker Thelma, becomes exposed to radioactive contamination, or \\\\\"cooked.\\\\\"  For me, this sequence is one of the most disturbing.  Thelma is probably only in her 40s, but she looks like she\\'s ready for retirement, due to the hard life she has lived.  Her daughter is dying of cancer, and she herself wears wigs most days, because her hair is falling out.  It\\'s hard to watch the weeping, pleading Thelma being forcibly scrubbed head to toe with a stiff brush, water being shot into her eyes and nose, in a dubious attempt to \\\\\"decontaminate\\\\\" her.  She is then patronized by a doctor who straight-facedly assures her that she has only superficial exposure and will be just fine.There is fear when Karen sticks her neck out -- talking to union reps, traveling to Washington, and being sent back to work with a dangerous assignment: to gather evidence.  At one point in the film, absolutely no one is supporting her.  Her roommate feels resentful and rejected; her boyfriend has moved out, jealous of her involvement with the sophisticated people from Washington, and her co-workers treat her like a pariah, afraid that being seen talking to her will brand them as troublemakers, endangering their jobs, or even their lives.Their worries seem more and more valid as the movie progresses.  She walks into a roomful of supervisors, and they all fall silent.  Suddenly, every time she walks past a radiation monitor, the alarms sound and she, like Thelma, is dragged to the dreaded decon room, where her skin is scrubbed raw -- torture chillingly disguised as medical necessity.  Even her home is no longer safe.  Plutonium is found in a urine sample that she brings from home, and every item in her house--right down to the wallpaper--is emptied and taken away from her.  Her stone-faced, smooth-talking boss is right there, encouraging her to sign a statement that will undoubtedly absolve the company of any responsibility.The headlights Karen sees in her rear-view mirror are not the last thing we see that frightens us.  It\\'s her wrecked car being slowly towed past the restaurant where a union meeting is still in progress.\\\\nThe movie hits so many of our fear buttons: Helplessness, loneliness, rejection, vulnerability, and finally, the bottom-line thing we all fear the most.  The most encouraging note is the awareness that anyone who sees this movie will come away with.  It\\'s a blueprint for empowerment.e.w.',\n",

You can add Sleepaway Camp to that list.  This is a typical scary film.  It has it's moments and it is scary in some parts.  It has some nice humour especially when they play camp jokes on each other.  But having said all that, this movie is as good as it is and it's not too bad ) because the mother in this film is creepier than Mrs. Bates and she actually makes you want to kill her.  But the two parts that I will never forget are images that are firmly planted in my brain, especially the part of it that stores nasty horror elements in it.\\\\nThe first was the death by curling iron.  It is so horrific that it bothered me so much that I had to cover my eyes the second time I saw it.  It is qutie graphic, not because of what they show, but because you know how nasty it is.But the one thing that will stay with me and probably anyone else that has seen this film is the very end.  That last shot is so horrific, so way out of left field that you never see it coming.  It just hits you and then it ends.  It has a power of its own.

Murphy was at the top of his game back then and Aykroyd is the perfect snob-class elitist. Some of these jokes are so timeless that I still refer to them from time-to-time and they STILL get laughs, both from people who have and haven't seen this film.Yes, the jokes are a bit dated and somewhat slapstick, but this was a sign of the times. Most 80s comedies were full of slapstick moments. Jamie Lee Curtis was at the height of her sexy image and I'd forgotten how well she'd played her role. The late Don Ameche is so animated that it played perfectly into the mood of the film.You can find this film in the bargain bin of most stores these days. I saw it for sale for only $5.50.

And why old Lucifer has chosen to possess a billion ears of corn in Nebraska {instead of the John Deere tractor sitting alongside of it} is beyond me. Whatever the reason, the fact that he\\'s somewhere within that cornfield gave me the chills throughout this film. More chills than watching these children go on a killing rampage throughout the small town. Anyone over the age of 17 was quickly laid to rest at the beginning of the film, and any kid about to turn 18 happily sacrificed themselves to \\\\\"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\\\\\".The film stars Peter Horton and Linda (Terminator 1 and 2\\'s) Hamilton.

But this movie moved me to tears, especially at the end when they did Mozart\\'s REQUIEM while he was working on what was to be his last piece of music. Now, I\\'m a Mozart fiend. This was a great movie. True, there are some historical inaccuracies. Anyone who has studied music history knows that Sallieri did not help Mozart with his Requiem. It was a student of his named Sussmayer. But it does make this story ironic, that the man who was so dedicated to the ruination of Mozart ended up helping him in the end. (I question the historical accuracy of that as well.) I recently bought the director\\'s cut to this movie. Until I saw the director\\'s cut, Sallieri seemed like a more sympathetic character, someone who just couldn\\'t buy a break. Who can\\'t identify with that? But after seeing the director\\'s cut and seeing what I think is an important scene between Sallieri and Mozart\\'s wife, he seemed more like a jerk. You also understand why Frau Mozart was so rude to Sallieri at the end of the movie, whereas before, you see the next to the last scene and you think, \\\\\"Whoa! Where did this come from?\\\\\" This was a great movie, for entertainment value only. If you want historical accuracy, watch a documentary or read a biography from the library or something.

The great thing is that the movie shows that the old man comes to need the kid as much as the kid needs him, it is a touching relationship.

But now, I can see that the film has got something unique, which makes the film different from other horror movies. I think it`s down to the basic idea of this film - dreams and everything that can happen in our dreams sometimes become true. The authors of this film did not have to be bound with the need to stay realistic and that opens a free way to their wildest imaginations. Charles Bernstein`s music in this movie has become clasic and we can hear the basic melodic motive in some of the sequels. Original music composed by different authors in the sequels to this first Nightmare stays far far behind Bernstein`s masterpiece.',\n",

It is also virtually unique in the successful portrayal of a man who is deeply lost in his innermost thoughts that the outside world becomes almost a minutiae. Mr Stanton encapsulates this mood perfectly and this is probably his best performance ever. The most moving scene (and there are many) might be when he reviews some old cine film of his life (a normal happy love story which surely could not have gone wrong so badly)before he walked away from it all.

And that is what is particularly scary about a film like \\\\\"The Terminator.\\\\\" In \\\\\"The Terminator,\\\\\" Arnold plays a cyborg, Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader, John Connor (who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising). If Connor is killed, then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future, and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time, to help save his mother. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tells Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) about the machine that is trying to kill her. \\\\\"It can\\'t be bargained with, it can\\'t feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead!\\\\\" Talk about a bad day.The Terminator hunts them down time after time, including the famous police station scene, where Arnie says, \\\\\"I\\'ll be back,\\\\\" and returns moments later, crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops, but don\\'t worry, Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.There are countless classic scenes in \\\\\"The Terminator.\\\\\" You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator, to the lines they speak, to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.On the special edition \\\\\"T2\\\\\" DVD (the second one), there is an on-set documentary for the making of the \\\\\"Terminator 2\\\\\" 3-D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around, it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else, and Cameron gets a tone. \\\\\"No, no, that won\\'t work. You do it like this - we come off here, he walks around...\\\\\" etc. The point is, he\\'s a perfectionist, and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy, and don\\'t really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants, and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It\\'s hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it\\'s even harder to find plot holes.Some people say \\\\\"Terminator 2 - Judgment Day\\\\\" is better than the original. It\\'s hard to choose, because the two films are very different. I view \\\\\"The Terminator\\\\\" as more of a deep, intellectually-consuming, dark thriller. I view \\\\\"Judgment Day\\\\\" as an action film, with a more or less recycled plot. (The plot is still good, but it\\'s still the same, too.) It\\'s hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On \\\\\"T2\\\\\" the budget is ten times larger, probably even more than that. But if you want a horror/thriller, \\\\\"The Terminator\\\\\" is better for you. If you want special-effects and a really fun time, see \\\\\"T2.\\\\\" They\\'re both excellent films.\\\\\"The Terminator\\\\\" is a great movie. It is one of my favorites; it is terrifying, horrifying, and 100 % entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there, \\\\\"The Terminator\\\\\" has some thought put into its plot, and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind.',\n",

There are heaps of familiar faces, including small parts from many of the present day \\'movie stars\\' ie John Cusack, Joan Cusack and Jami Gertz.  It\\'s kind of daggy though, and when you tell people you watched it their response is usually \\\\\"Oh My God.  That is so OLD.\\\\\"  But that\\'s what I like about it.

Anthony Michael Hall is rightly celebrated and gorgeous Molly Ringwald deserves her fame in the teen hall of Stardom. Whatever happened to Michael Schoeffling (Jake)....anyone know? It seems incongruous that so many future stars got their start in this film yet he seemed to go nowhere.

       " \"This wasn't a big hit when it came out, but it should have been. Martin Scorsese is a master of creating atmosphere and exploring a specific setting, and he has proved that in movies like Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York. In this film he brings the SoHo of the early to mid 1980s to life in brilliant and surreal fashion. Griffin Dunne is a great Every Man character. You like him from the very first scene and you follow his adventures with excitement and dread. The tension in this film is also intense, and that is amazing for a light hearted comedy. I am always surprised to hear that people have not seen this movie, or that people don't like this movie. I urge all Scorsese fans to see it. It's one of his best, even though many critics did not like it when it came out. It's a cult hit, but it deserves to be more than that too. It's a masterpiece.\",\n",

Along the way we meet feisty Linda Fiorentino, whimsical Verna Bloom, Gorgeous but hysterical Teri Garr and Dusty Springfield look alike Catherine O'Hara. We also get to witness suicide, murder, robbery and vigilante mobs in this tale of big city madness. The camera-work is stupendous and features every trick in the book.

       " '\\\\\"The Black Cauldron\\\\\" is not a typical Disney animated feature.  For one thing, it\\'s not a G-rated musical.  In fact, it was the first-ever Disney feature to receive a PG rating.  The story comes from the works of Lloyd Alexander, in the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien.  In it, Taran, a young pig-keeper must protect Henwen, a prophetic pig who can divine the whereabouts of a powerful weapon known as the Black Cauldron.  The demonic Horned King is after this bastion of black magic to create an invincible army of the undead.  This movie boasts impressive art shot in 70mm widescreen format, art which includes the contributions of a young Tim Burton.  Sadly, this feature did poorly in theaters, possibly being too frightening, or going over the heads of Disney\\'s usual target audience.

The beginning of the story begins slow and exponentially increases til the very end. The speed at which the actors are delivering their lines is staggering at some points, and goes to the technical grace of the actors like Christopher Lloyd and Leslie Ann Warren.

To get her back he has to kill someone else.An 80s action film all the way. It's full of noisy battles, tons of gun play, loads of fistfights and a grand total of EIGHTY-ONE bloody on-screen deaths! The film works so well because it has a good, strong sense of humor and never takes itself seriously. It makes all the blood and gore seem cartoonish. The plot barrels also full speed and it's very short (88 min). Also Rae Dawn Chong (whatever happened to...?) is very good in a supporting role. My only complaint is that the final battle between Arnie and psycho Vernon Wells (badly overacting) is way too violent--even for this film. Otherwise, well worth seeing--lots of fun if you don't mind mindless, violent films (like me).

Here\\'s a list of things I discovered while watching this film:When a large amount of cocaine is under the floor of a boat, and the people on that boat need to be moved, you shoot them all and they\\'ll not only miraculously fall away from the door to the cocaine, but not one bag of coke will be damaged, despite firing about a thousand bullets at the boat.All Cuban refugees that arrive in the Florida area wear identical plain white underwear and shorts.Chuck Norris can single-handedly take down tens of terrorists, but needs help to take on one alligator.Prostitutes carry flick knives.The guards to a big drug dealer only need to be shot at twice, and they\\'ll then die of fear. There\\'s no other way to explain their deaths despite not being hit by either bullet sent in their direction.The main characters to a movie don\\'t need any background. Rostov is known only by name, as is Hunter, while the terrorist 2IC isn\\'t given a surname. No further details on the pasts of these characters are necessary for you to understand what\\'s going on, especially the dream sequence.A terrorist leader who has no qualms about killing boatloads of refugees, houses of innocent people and blowing up shopping centres goes into uncontrollable rages about one-liners like \\\\\"It\\'s time to die.\\\\\"The head of Hunter\\'s ex-agency (NSA? CIA? FBI? Who cares!) gets to his place via a rowboat, and comes alone.A variety of bad guys blow Hunter\\'s house up with a lot of rocket launchers, machine guns and RPGs, with the intent of killing him - yet don\\'t check that he\\'s dead afterwards.Rocket launchers carry six rockets without the need to reload.Likewise, shotguns carry around 17 shots without the need to reload.Terrorists who have important business to get to don\\'t do it, because they need to go into clubs to pick up cheap, old hookers who are slightly overweight.Between six guys with automatic weapons, they\\'re unable to hit the windows in Chuck Norris\\'s car, or put it out of commission. Despite firing around 500 bullets.Uzis are more accurate than any other weapon. Mostly because Chuck Norris is firing them.A professional photographer, when riding in a car that\\'s attempting to chase a hostage-taking terrorist down, doesn\\'t take any photos.It\\'s impossible to blow up terrorists with their own bombs unless you deliver a one-liner first.School children sing \\\\\"Row, row, row your boat...\\\\\" for minutes endlessly while on a school bus.Chuck Norris catches up to a moving bus over 250 metres ahead of him, picks a bomb off it, catches up to a speeding car of terrorists, who are clearly a long way ahead of the bus, places the bomb on their car and drives off. In under 25 seconds. From a standing start.Automatic weapons, like shotguns and rocket launchers, carry more bullets than you can physically fit into the weapons.When you\\'re involved in a fight with a fast opponent, where mobility and fast firing is imperative, a rocket launcher truly is the weapon of choice. Then again, it does hold six shots.In closing, it\\'s time to die.',\n",

I mean, goddamn, what more do you want? I personally want another movie just set in Bartertown AND a movie that follows what happens to Anna Goanna and her clan, and they don't even have to have Mel Gibson in them - that's how rich I think the imaginative depth of this movie is.

       " 'Rocky IV (1985) is definitely one of the best Sport action films of the 80\\'s! It is my number one favorite best movie in the Rocky series! I love this movie to death and I don\\'t care what anyone says. It was my first film I saw it as a kid, it is my childhood film and I grew up with this movie! Sylvester Stallone did gave us one of his the most best performances of the Rocky character ever! This film along side with Rocky III is very underrated, misunderstood, bashed and dissed off from fans and it\\'s critics! I love this film to death and it has a special place in my heart. The film has everything that I love in a Rocky film. It is fast paced and Entertained from beginning till end.The film goes very fast, is not boring, dull or lame, it is actually pretty good film, is not bad is actually good. The fourth installment of the Rocky series isn\\'t the greatest film like, were his predecessors but it is still a good film. People: It\\'s not that bad. In fact, it\\'s really good. Okay, it isn\\'t a classic like the first two movies were, and it suffers further by comparison to \\\\\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\\\\" which came out six months before it. But \\\\\"Part IV,\\\\\" was still one of the best movies of its year (1985). That fight at the end was EPIC, just amazing. As for the music, Bill Conti is great but so is Vince Dicola! Vince is a genius on synthesizer music. The fight at the end was a literal clash of the titans level bout, and his music fit it so perfectly! Rocky IV remained the highest grossing sports movie for 24 years before it was overtaken by The Blind Side. It is the fourth and most financially successful entry in the Rocky film series.As a kid Rocky IV was always my favorite best movie. It still is alongside with Rocky I,III and Balboa! It is sad that Apollo dies in this movie I hated that, but the rest was pretty fast entertaining, well faced paced entertained action movie. This is the first movie that place actually took in a different country and not in the US. I love when Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) fly\\'s to Russia to fight the best undefeated champion Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). The training sequences were awesome the fight sequences were entertained and very paced amazing. The soundtracks for this movie were pretty awesome and great. James Brown Living in America was awesome. The fight between Rocky and Drago was set on 25th December Christmas. This is the first Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. The Fourth movie was one of the best Sport action movies Directed by Sylvester Stallone, he made such a great wonderful performance I love You Sly. Without you there wouldn\\'t be Rocky.I have heard a lot about this film: Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago really did not get along and got into an a real fight during filming. Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up. You can even see the scene during a press conference regarding the match, hostility is created between Apollo and Drago\\'s respective camps. The fight really went out of hand. Carl Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Sylvester Stallone forced and convince those two macho ego actors to comeback and finishing the film. The major problem with this film I have is killing the most best awesome character Apollo Creed. In Rocky sequel almost everyone dies. The killing one of the most favorite characters was one of the worst idea Stallone ever had. In Rocky III Mickey dies, in Rocky IV Apollo dies in Rocky Balboa Adrian Dies. Stallone kept killing our favorite characters but he memorized them. The movie wasn\\'t filmed in Russia which that really disappointed me and I think Stallone should have visit Russia and film at least one scene there. I love sound effects and Rocky IV is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new special effects. I love everything that it is about this film, everything!\\\\\"When east meets west, the champion remains standing\\\\\" Rocky Balboa,heavyweight champion of the world, is the trainer for Apollo Creed in an exhibition match against Ivan Drago, a \\\\\"superman\\\\\" boxer from the Soviet Union. When Apollo is killed in the ring by the brutal Drago, Balboa blames himself and promises to avenge his friend\\'s death in the ring. That is the basic and simply plot of the most awesome sport action film of the 80\\'s! Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports film written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the film. The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen, and Michael Pataki. That is the basic plot of the awesome sport action film!The rating I am giving a 10, I love this film to death, I grew up with it and it is my number1 favorite Rocky Film!',\n",

Actually, the relationship of Danny Glover to the main protagonists IS socially important, so enjoy that too.',\n",
       " \"alongside Kubrick. this great story was wasted on Kuro's pointless direction, bad performances, horrible action, and was completely untrue to samurai, its disgraceful. First of all why did some of the samurai have guns? samurai didn't use guns, its against their honor, something Akira knows nothing about, just like Seven Samurai, the worst movie ever made, worse then this pile of bull. Its also disgraceful to Shakespeare's great story, something deserving of a much better film. This movie was made in 1985 so why is Akira stuck in 1950, at least thats what it looked and felt like, it had no meaning, no point, and it was boring, almost as much as 2001. 0 out of a 10 for this and Akira.\",\n",
       " '\\\\\"Return of the Living Dead\\\\\" is an often hilarious, often frightening, often disgusting, and always entertaining horror comedy. The cast is great, the dialogue is snappy and very quotable, and the special effects still hold up very well, nearly 20 years after the film\\'s release. Fans of the horror genre, 1980s buffs, or just folks who enjoy something different occasionally will most likely get a kick out of it.10/10',\n",
       " 'Worthy of the director of \\\\\"French Connection,\\\\\" the pace of this set- in-LA action thriller immediately draws the view in and never lets up. A car chase in the best traditions of \\\\\"Bullitt\\\\\" and of Friedkin\\'s own \\\\\"French Connection\\\\\" is centers the action, but the motivation of a rogue agent obsessed with the death of his partner, and clearly with his own death, are well- and credibly- drawn. The most sympathetic character in the story is not one of the principals. It is a female informer. An ex-con at the mercy of those on both sides of the law, she is callously exploited by all. Her feelings for Agent Chance are more implied than explicit, but they are believable as is his indifference to her as a person. This riveting film never lets your attention wander. Thanks to Friedkin, we are told, we are given a credible ending to this taut, tightly- wound thriller. An under-exposed, under-appreciated work; excellent for the genre.',\n",

All the characters are amoral, dirty and sordid, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any of them. There are excellent scenes, such as the car chase in the streets of Los Angeles, or the surprising lethal shooting in the end of the story. The DVD shows a commercial alternative ending of the story, fortunately not accepted by the director William Friedkin. The unpredictable and credible end as it is makes the great difference of this outstanding movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \\\\\"Viver e Morrer em Los Angeles\\\\\" (\\\\\"To Live and Die in Los Angeles\\\\\")',\n",
       " \"A View to a Kill (1985) is guilty pleasure of mine. I don't think it is a terrible movie like mostly people are saying. I love this film always did and it is one of my favorite Bond films. This is the last Roger Moore movie he did before he was passing on Timothy Dalton. It is very underrated and I know that Roger Moore him self has stated that A View to a Kill is his at least favorite James Bond film because Christopher Walken was machine gunning everyone. I have enjoyed the film it was fast paced, entertaining and it had action. I know it does have flaws and mistakes like every movie does. I have enjoyed action and Roger Moore was good in his performance. He did 100% off him and he is acting was decent it wasn't so much goofy or terrible in my opinion.A View to a Kill is the 14th entry in the official James Bond series and the final film to star Roger Moore in the role of Agent 007. The 1985 installment follows Bond as he investigates a possible plot to destroy California's Silicon Valley. The film's cast includes Christopher Walken, Grace Jones, Tanya Roberts and Dolph Lundgren, who made his acting debut.I will say I have simply enjoy this flick more then I did The Man With The Golden Gun, Octopussy, From Russia With Love, Skyfall, Spectre, Quantum of Solace, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day and of course the worst Bond ever On Her Majesty's Secret Service.The cast: Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton was in my opinion good Bond girl. I have read so many negative comments about her performance. Because she was screaming, she was way too young for Roger Moore she looked like his daughter etc. I disagree she was good and I have enjoyed her performance.Grace Jones as May Day was another bad girl just like Famke Janssen in GoldenEye. Grace Jones was good as May Day Zorin's lover and chief henchwoman I thought she was really good at her performance.Christopher Walken was good as Max Zorin: a psychopathic industrialist he was really a good bad guy and I have enjoyed his performance. He did his job good and convincing and it was good in his good effort.This was really the only movie that was filmed in the USA in which they used Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The movie really had a lot of action scenes. The car chases in San Francisco with fire truck the cops are chasing Bond and he with Stacey is fleeing trough the bridge. I love the mining scene in which May Day (Grace Jones) slide down Bond and they bring the larger bomb that would destroy the lock. They put the bomb on a handcar and push it out of the mine along a railroad line. May Day stays on the car to hold the faulty brake lever, sacrificing her own life as the bomb explodes.Great stunt on Eiffel Tower in which May Day jumps off the Eiffel Tower really great stunt scene. Great car scene in which Bond is chasing May Day with a stolen car. I know it was a stuntman and Roger Moore did not drive the car. In Stacey's house the fight with Bond and Zorin's henchman that wasn't Roger Moore fighting them that was his stuntman and it was funny, I thought the stuntman did a good job. But Tanya Roberts did her own stunts and she was good.I liked the opening scene in which Bond use a flare gun and shots down the helicopter that was cool. I really enjoy the song A View to a Kill from Duran Duran. I have enjoy the horse riding that was really joy able to me in which Bond races with the horse on the race track with Zorin and Zorin's henchman has set booby traps for Bond and Zorin's men get caught instead. I like Bond with a shotgun Remington and he has a rock salt in it. Pretty cool the first time we see Bond with the shotgun and rock salt.I did not thought that Roger Moore was that old or was that horrible, no he was really good at acting. I am sorry just my opinion. I like the burning elevator in the building in which Bond escapes and saves Stacey I love that sequence.I miss those kind of movies: like Rambo, Superman and James Bond 007 Roger Moore I miss movie like this? Why can't we get movies like this one back. Again I did not thought Tanya Roberts was horrible or Roger Moore is too old and Tanya Roberts is his daughter. This movie to me is unappreciated and I wasn't bored with it!9/10 better the Octopussy in my opinion it was good in my opinion. I have seen this movie so many times and I have always enjoyed it I always had fun with it.\",\n",

He caught sight of the face of one of the two attackers who killed him...As the plot becomes more intricate, and through a series of interesting events, detective John Book finds himself forced to protect the shy eight-year-old boy and his helpless mother... He disappears for some days in the Amish Country... Harrison Ford stars as a fugitive cop who is initially unwelcome in a community he knows a little about... He tries to learn the importance of family and community, the philosophy of brotherhood and non-resistance... He becomes involved in a case that will essentially change his human perceptions... And later, he finds himself falling in love with a sensitive young woman...Kelly McGillis is captivating as Rachel, a woman who feels a shadow of confusion crossing her mind... She stares at the honest cop, realizing the price he's paid in returning them to safety... In one scene she catches him watching her bath... She hesitates for a moment, but in that precise moment she makes a choice... Slowly she turns to face him, topless, without shame... For a moment she attempts a tender effort to become, for an instant, a woman of his world...In another scene we see her playing the charade of her life... Bound by duty, but tempted by desire, she leaves her white cap - symbol of her identity - on the table, and surrenders to a passion, that makes her sensual nature say it all...

Peter Weir tries to paint a realistic portrait of the Amish who are best known for their severely 'plain clothing' and their 'non-conformed' way of life... The Amish also avoid telephones and electric lights and drive horses and buggies rather than cars... Weir delivers a powerful and romantic story, an engaging film of different style, mixing two different cultures, the simplicity of the Amish lifestyle with the urban culture and fashion...

       " 'Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron\\'s classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the original \\\\\"Alien\\\\\", returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it\\'s war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven\\'t mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don\\'t like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love.  I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don\\'t see that. There\\'s plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its\\' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it\\'s not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it. I love this film to death it is my personal favorite sci-fi action film even Lance Henriksen from Hard Target and The Terminator is in here and he is the good guy.',\n",
       " '\\\\\"Aliens\\\\\" is the best trapped-with-a-monster-right-behind-you movie of all time.  The weird part is that it\\'s not the first of its kind.  Usually, the first of a genre is always the best but these kinds of movies were made decades-and-decades before 1986\\'s \\\\\"Aliens.\\\\\"  Still, through its strong story and characters, it elbows its way to the head of the class.Ripley is a heroine like no other.  She thrills you.  Her powerful presence and unstoppable soul will always live on in the minds of movie-goers.  She and Newt form a surrogate mother-daughter relationship that is more touching than anything I\\'ve seen before in this kind of a movie.  In this movie more than any other in the \\\\\"Alien\\\\\" series, Ripley\\'s a woman who does what she can (and then some) to protect herself and the ones around her.  She\\'s the perfect action hero.On top of that, the pulsing music that plays while Bishop is speeding them away from the exploding compound and while Ripley is booting  the Queen Alien out into space is beyond comparison.Note:  If you LOVED this movie, it\\'s probably best you don\\'t see Alien 3. It, for some reason, turns the triumph of this film\\'s conclusion into a depression deeper than the vastness of a hundred black holes.',\n",
       " \"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Every aspect of this movie is spot on, which I can only put down to James Cameron's obsessive attention to detail. The characters are distinct, memorable and believable. The plot builds slowly into the most tense, suspenseful roller-coaster ride I've ever experienced in the cinema. The special effects are good even by today's standards, and the sets are simply second to none. This is one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time.If you like this kind of movie and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Twenty years on and the only other Sci Fi action movie in the same league is James Cameron's Terminator 2. I can only hope he returns to this genre in the future, he is the master.Oh, and try to see the special extended edition if possible, the extra scenes make an amazing movie even better.\",\n",

Who cares about scary aliens when the supposed \\\\\"good guys\\\\\" are this sleazy? The cast fits the scummy people perfectly as these actors are known for these kind of roles.

I'm not going to tell about the story because, I'm sure, each one of us could tell it in very different ways. The blandness of Kyle MacLachland here is a major plus. It's not him that rivet us but his circumstances. And the circumstances are truly riveting, terrifying, unpredictable and gloriously cinematic. Dennis Hopper is superb, disgustingly so and Isabella Rossellini creates a character that was totally new to me. Related to many others but new, disturbingly so. Dean Stockwell has a moment that I know already will stay in my mind for ever. I'm so glad I finally saw it.\",\n",
       " 'My friends knowing that I\\'m a huge film buff asked me to come up with a list of my favorite movies of all time, when it came down to number one, there was one film that stood out in my head that I knew I could watch over and over again and never get sick of: Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off. One of the best comedies of all time, Ferris Bueller is a movie that just stands the test of time. How anyone could not love this film is beyond any of my understanding, Ferris Bueller is my hero among many others. John Hughes is usually remembered more for The Breakfast Club, which is an incredible movie as well, but I think this was his masterpiece. He said in an interview that this was his childhood, getting his wife and best friend and skipping out on school to go down town and just have a good time. If you are a Chicago citizen, you\\'ve pulled a Ferris Beuller\\'s day off too, it\\'s like a law here, lol, if you haven\\'t, I pity you. The reason that this movie works is because of it\\'s outrageous story that everyone wants to live, Matthew Broderick, there was no other choice, he is who everyone wants to be: Ferris Bueller.Ferris Bueller is a teenager who fakes out his parents on being sick, even though it is his worst performance of being ill, somehow it works and his parents let him stay home. He takes the gorgeous day outside, takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times. I\\'m not kidding fellow Chicagoians, this is the best Chicago movie! Ferris has two problems though, his principal who is sick of being made a fool of and decides to bust Ferris on his fake illness. And his sister Jeanie, who cares more about Ferris\\'s life than her own and just wants to prove that he\\'s faking it.Even though, you have to admit that it\\'s a bit unrealistic that it is broadcast throughout Chicago that Ferris is \\\\\"dying\\\\\" and no one notices that he\\'s singing in the Chicago parade, on a field trip to the Art Institute with an elementary class, getting \\\\\"snootie\\\\\" with a waiter at Chicago\\'s finest restaurant, and catching the Cub\\'s home run ball at Wrigley Field, you just have fun and cannot stop laughing. Plus you have got to love Edward Rooney, the obsessed principal who is actually sicker than Ferris in one way of putting it. He goes through the whole city to find him just so Ferris doesn\\'t make a fool of him, but he fails on all levels because Ferris is just that awesome. The scene between him and Grace when Cameron prank calls to get Ferris\\' girlfriend out of school is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I don\\'t know what else to honestly say other than this movie is the best comedy to watch if you are looking for a great laugh. So sit, back and enjoy because \\\\\"\\\\u0085life moves pretty fast. If you don\\'t stop and take a look around once in a while, you might miss it\\\\\"; my philosophy. I will love Ferris Bueller till the day I die.10/10',\n",
       " \"Broderick banked off that boyish charm that made him so popular on the Broadway stage (Brighton Beach Memoirs) and brought it to this witty laugh ride about a high schooler who one day, just didn't want to go to school and puts himself and his friends in constant mayhem and jeopardy. Broderick is perfect, but it is Jeffrey Jones who gives a searing comic potryal of Ed Rooney, a Mr. Weatherbee-like principal wanting to catch Ferris in only act of treachery; holding him back for one more year of high school. John Hughes is at his best here. The dialogue for this film has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them. It's a classic!\",\n",
       " \"Most science fiction films are big on ideas and special effects, but weak on coherence and character development; most horror films are just the same, except without the ideas. But David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' takes one simple idea, develops it properly, and eschews (its genuinely terrifying) special effects until its truly horrific climax. And by paying some attention to the personalities of its protagonists, it actually makes you care about them (Jeff Goldblum is excellent in the lead role), and adds a level of serious reflection on the very nature of human mortality to the raw shock. The mix amounts to a gruesomely good film.\",\n",
       " \"I think that this is a grossly underrated film - a noteworthy landmark in modern horror. I would expect nothing less than excellent from my favourite director Cronenberg, and this doesn't disappoint. Goldblum's performance is particularly good as the nervy scientist Brundle, but I think the main reason for the film's achievement is its structure - very subtle, very well made. Most of the action takes place in the last third of the picture, but there is a great suspense building up to that point. And the special effects are jaw-dropping - Brundle's hideous transformation is reminiscent of Lynch's 'The Elephant Man'. This film has a reputation for being unnecessarily gory, which is actually not at all true. It is a very intelligent picture, about love and other issues as much as horror, and a must-see for anyone.\",\n",

Its full of romance, heroism and over all loss. A very involving and emotional film. The Queen song \\\\\"Who wants to live forever\\\\\" never fails to stir emotions. The battle scenes are also very good. What also makes the film work is the casting. The Highlanders all look very brave and fearless not to mention scarred. Also the costumes are fantastic. I\\'m mo expert on the exact clothing for Highlanders in the 16th century, but they looked pretty good to me. I had no real feelings about Scotland before I watched this film, But after the film got under my skin it was the next place I visited. I was amazed to find that there really is a Glen Finnan on the shore of Loch Sheil. And I can say first hand that it is a truly historicaly magical place.',\n",

People like me, who were born 10-15 years after the war ended, knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit, her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier\\'s rifle and she, along with tenth of other village kids, was saved by my grand-mother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying, shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers.

       " 'In all fairness, this Belorussian-made World War II picture detailing Nazi atrocities, holds a special distinction in world cinema: it is by far the most brutal and emotionally draining of all - in fact, a viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable. Those brave souls willing to be put through an ordeal of almost 2 1/2 hours will find themselves deeply immersed in an absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it to or not.The title, \\\\\"Come and See\\\\\", taken from the frequently repeating lines of the book of Revelation, clearly dares the audience to assume the role of St. John, witnessing the Apocalypse, or rather one of the darkest periods in the history of humankind. What we are assaulted with, plays somewhat like a demented version of \\\\\"Modern Times\\\\\" transpiring across the panel of Brueghel\\'s \\\\\"Trimuph of Death\\\\\", if such a combination is possible. The camera is consistently filtered through a murky, slightly unfocused gaze, and the sound is often heard through shellshocked ears. This tends to eirly distance the events, yet make them even more frightening and unsettling. Much of the dialogue lacks specific meaning or even concrete sentences - it is replaced by subhuman growling, wailing and other spine-chilling, gluttural sounds of the war. What the director prepares is something Spielberg would never even dream of - no sign of compromise with the audience. A crowd of civilian villagers locked up in a barn by Nazi soldiers is not spared at the last minute like \\\\\"Schindler List\\'s\\\\\" Jews- they are burned alive, and we get to watch all of it.Unlike most of the films in this genre, \\\\\"Come and see\\\\\" relies mainly on images and sounds instead of a coherent plot, which is not necesserily a weakness, since the sheer terror distorts time and space into a kind of hallucinatory blur, clearly intentional and understandable. But this incredible level of bleak intensity in the long run, has a negative effect on the film: the viewers have to desensitize themselves just so they can keep watching, so the most harrowing scenes are sat through in numbness.Another questionable move on the director\\'s part is his occasional use of surrealism. While some visuals are painfully believable, while others are simply baffling: crazed villages consructing an effigy of Hitler, a pensive German commander with a pet slender loris (a rare African primate) on his shoulder, a female Nazi eating raw red lobster, not even mentioning a bizzare final montage wich is both inexplicable and obvious, ending with a real-life photograph that is perhaps the most terrifying of all in its implications. Yes, at times the movie overachieves its goals and seems almost like the footage in \\\\\"The Clockwork Orange\\\\\" that they made Alex watch to cure him of \\\\\"ultraviolent\\\\\" behaviour; yet other times it delivers the kind of jolts those accustomed to mainstream cinema could only wish they had. The face of a youth who had lost all sanity and aged many decades over several days, will be etched for an indefinite amount of time into the memory of anyone who has seen this film.',\n",
       " 'Come and See (1985)**** I first saw this movie a couple of years ago. I didn\\'t really know what to think of it at first. The soundtrack on the DVD is a little messy and the acting was a bit strange. I knew it had affected me though in a way that not many other movies had. As time went by I began to realize just how much of an impact the movie had on me. It really, really stuck with me. One night, while writing a review of Errol Morris\\'s latest documentary \\\\\"Fog of War\\\\\", I found myself thinking more and more about Come and See, and decided that I had to watch it again immediately. I ran out after midnight and rented it, and watched it 3 times or so over the next week. I started to see why the film had been haunting me and sticking around my thoughts. The reason was that this movie is simply a masterpiece.Elem Klimov directs the film, starring Aleksei Kravchenko as Florya, a young boy who desires to fight with the Partisan\\'s army against the invading Nazi army. He digs until he finds a rifle, then the next day he is off to a camp in the middle of the woods. The scene is chaotic it seems and unorganized. The fighters try to take a photo that takes about 5 minutes to accomplish because everyone keeps messing up their positions. Florya spots Glasha (Olga Mironova), a young girl, who has the younger fighters swooning over her, and who also seems to have some sort of relationship with the leader of the camp. What that relationship is exactly we never find out. Florya gets left behind on the attack because he is perhaps too young, and besides another older fighter needs some new boots, and swaps with the new kid. .The anxious Florya is upset by this decision and he takes to the woods for some solitude, he cries and then discovers that near by Glasha is also crying at being left at the camp, more so for being left alone than behind. The two begin to bond and end up in an open field when German planes attack and begin to bomb the encampment. The scenes that follow next teeter on the brink of madness on film. Come and See is likely one of the most maddening films ever made for that matter. The key is the soundtrack. Florya is struck deaf for a few moments by the bombs. Sounds are muffled, but not like anything you\\'ve ever seen in a Hollywood film. The soundtrack is a mix of strange ringing and sounds and music, adding to the atmosphere of chaos that the two youngsters have now been thrown into. Much of the film has this style of soundtrack, which makes the Florya\\'s descent into madness much more poignant.The film movies forward from here back to Florya\\'s village which has now been deserted. The two head to an island on the other side of a bog where Florya believes the town is hiding along with his mother and sisters. The scene where they climb through the mud is another example of Florya losing his mind. The soundtrack again becomes ambient and menacing in its strange blends of sounds. They eventually find some villagers and Florya now even more loses his sanity, along with some of his hair, which is given to recreate a statue of Hitler. This will be the last time we see Glasha in the movie, as Florya goes with a party to collect food for the starving people.The most famous scene, and the one that will likely never leave you, is of a village being ransacked by Nazi soldiers. The scene is chaotic and culminates in a barn stuffed with the townspeople being burned and shot apart. Another one of the most famous shots from the movie is of Florya shooting a photo of Hitler, each bullet making time reverse. The photo goes back in time until it is a picture of Hitler as a baby on his mothers lap. He is an innocent infant, and Florya cannot bring himself to fire another shot. These shots are incredibly powerful and they stick in your mind.Obviously, Come and See was filmed with influences of Soviet Propaganda in it, but it hardly matters because it is so well made and so maddening you can\\'t help but be totally absorbed by the experience. The movie has a hypnotic quality about it, and without being horrifying because it\\'s a jump out of your seat surprise bloodbath, it is horrifying in its representation of the cruelty people are capable of in war.I can\\'t remember ever seeing another film that expressed the descent into madness any better and being so involving as Come and See. By the end of the film, you feel like you\\'ve just experienced what it must be like to lose your mind. The film never goes into the desensitizing of violence in war. Instead it focuses on the violence which causes those who witness to become desensitized from the madness of its cruelty.Elem Klimov created this film out of his actors and their emotions, and essentially used the viewer as another character. This movie draws you in and makes you experience exactly what the characters must. There are few other films that do that to you, especially to the extent that this one does it. And for that, Come and See is not only a masterpiece, it\\'s really one of the best films you\\'ll ever see. Find it, but don\\'t just watch it. Allow it to take you in; even if that means you have to see it a couple times. Let it take you in, and you\\'re in for an experience rarely found in cinema anymore',\n",
       " \"World War II in Belarus, in the region near the Polish borders. Compelled by patriotism and youthful idealism one young boy (Aleksei Kravchenko) leaves his village to fight with the Soviet partisan resistance against the Nazi invasion. Within minutes his innocence is stripped away and the premature knowledge of war is revealed to him. He gets away from his unit and returns home, only to find the whole village including his family slaughtered and their bodies stacked behind an old farm!The horrendous depiction of war that Klimov creates is unique in the history of cinema. There is no plot, only a terrifying wandering in the nature, as the boy comes face to face with constant terrorizing and horrendous scenarios. Heroisms and sacrifices do not exist, nor inspiring speeches that excite the people to resist and fight the enemy. There is only the unexpected, death, violence and victims! A poem of a nightmare, relentlessly grim, deeply disturbing, and made unquestionably more dread-inducing by the fact that almost everything depicted really happened, it is a depressing but necessary reminder of one of the darkest chapters in human history. Idi i Smotri also manages to be both poetic and realistic and that is a supreme accomplishment on the part of the director.The film depicts real and surreal images that only war can justify. Transporting us back to World War II setting with its aptly-chosen locations and era-appropriate set pieces Alexei Rodionov's documentarian cinematography incorporates a lot of steady-cam and captures the events without any interruptions by employing long takes, and stands as one of the best films to use it as extensively as this one does, while desaturated colour tones add an urgency and bleak feel to its aura. The imagery at times is darkly psychedelic and truly arouses a sense of fear within the viewer because Fliora's surroundings are often made to seem out of this world. Such an image is the one where a soldier of the resistance, using mud, pieces of wood and a Nazi uniform, creates a German soldier totem. The widows and the mothers attack the totem and destroy it in a primitive act of violence and catharsis. There are moments in which the film is depicted through the eyes of the protagonist, and all sounds collapse into oblivion, reinforcing his deafness after the bombs' explosions.Come and See is one of the most affecting and confrontational war films ever made. The majority of war films claiming to be anti-war, show heroic acts with weapons and very capable soldiers that can save the day. Come and see does not offer such relief and comfort. It shows that in the war there are only victims. Though no one could possibly describe the experience of watching Come and See as a fun time, the film is nonetheless a masterpiece, worthy of consideration as not just the best war movie ever made, but also one of the greatest films ever made. Come and See is an enduring landmark of Soviet cinema whose potency and relevance will never be diminished by the test of time.\",\n",
       " 'Historical note:\\\\\"The film concerns the Nazi policy of \\\\\"total annihilation\\\\\" in the republic of Byelorussia (now known as Belarus or White Russia, adjacent to Poland) in 1943. The racial policy of the Nazis was to eliminate all \\\\\"inferior races\\\\\" such as Jews and Slavs from Eastern Europe and to make land available for German settlement in the east (Lebensraum). Because of the importance of Eastern Europe to Nazi policy the bulk of the German Army was sent to the eastern rather than the western front. Estimated that 20 million or more Russians (by Russians I mean the people of many nationalities that included Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Jews and many others who used to live on the Soviet territories occupied by Germans during 1941-1943) died fighting Hitler (recent estimates place figure 25-30 million). Units of the SS (Schutzstaffel) and SD (Sicherheitsdienst) were used to carry out the genocide. The SD was separated from the main body of the German Army (Wehrmacht) and made up of fanatical Nazis and fascist East European (often from the Baltic) collaborators.\\\\\"Elem Klimov\\'s and Ales Adamovich\\'s Film is perhaps one of the most powerful and horrifying films about the war (I would add Tarkovsky\\'s \\\\\"The Childhood of Ivan\\\\\" aka \\\\\"Ivanovo Detstvo\\\\\" and Mikhail Romm\\'s documentary \\\\\"Obyknovenny Fascism\\\\\" aka \\\\\"Ordinary Fascism\\\\\" aka \\\\\"Triumph Over Violence\\\\\"). Not for a moment would the film let the viewer relax. With each scene, the feeling of horror increases. We are transformed into the main character, 16 year old boy Florya. We are forced to see with his eyes, to hear with his ears. In the beginning of the film, Florya is a child. At the end, after having witnessed the unspeakable terrors of the fascists, he becomes an adult, and not just an adult \\\\u0096 an old man. His face is the face of War \\\\u0096 and it is to us, the viewers, authors say \\\\u0096 come and look in this face if you dare. War unmistakably selects as its victims the weakest, the youngest and the tenderest - the authors could not go against this truth. In the military camp, Florya meets the young girl, Glasha. Together, they try to make their way to the village where his family lived. But no one is there, it is empty - it is burnt out. And again some force pushes Florya, Glasha and us to go further. But where? To the shed where the women and the children are burning alive? Into the hands of the rapists- fascists? Or to be photographed with the revolver put at your temple, surrounded by the laughing SS-men? Is there any way out of the Inferno of War? The mystery of the final episode\\\\u0085 Florya can not force himself to shoot the child at the photograph sitting at his mother\\'s lap. Even if the child\\'s name is Adolph Hitler. Florya puts his rifle down. The clear blue sky is above him. Sounds Mozart\\'s \\\\\"Requiem\\\\\". What is this? Victory? Or defeat? Did Florya survive or did he perish like millions and millions during the endless days, months, and years of the worst war the humankind had known? Even if survived physically, he is a changed forever man, the man who looked triumphant death and horror in the eye for too long to ever forget them.',\n",

I don't want to think how it felt or have some weird imagery, I wanted to see more actual fighting, and how the war was perceived by soldiers not a 12 year old boy  The movie was not cohesive at all it reminded my of a Thin Red Line, if you like that movie you would like this.

       " \"Besides the fact that it was released without much hoopla in 1986, and that it was recently remade(the same exact movie except for the end) as Red Dragon, Manhunter is undoubtedly the most overlooked movie of the past 20 years. The plot is tremendous, Mann's direction is outstanding, and the acting(especially Noonan) is equally amazing. What Mann realized while making this film is that a thriller was not just meant to shock and disgust the audience but to develop the characters carefully so that there is an even greater sense of anticipation for the climax of the movie than there otherwise would be. Recent thrillers are clearly lacking in the character development that made movies like Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs so good. Its a shame that Red Dragon had to be made, since it is basically a strait ripoff of Manhunter except for a different ending which is much worse than the original and way too predictable. Anyone who thinks Red Dragon was a good movie should watch Manhunter and compare the two. If you try this you'll see that there is no comparison. Tom Noonan's performance alone is worth the watch.\",\n",
       " \"I found myself emotionally devastated after seeing this film the first time. The film packs a punch in its contrast between the beauty of nature and human self-sacrifice on the one hand and the depths of human self-interest and ruthlessness on the other.  Its theme is as relevant today as it was in the 1600s - what are  the consequences of my actions, and what price must be paid by me and by others as a result?  The film depicts several characters with whose choices the viewer can identify - the missionary, the repentant killer, the papal legate - and gives no easy answers to the choices that confront them.  But the fact that there are no easy answers doesn't let them off the hook.  In the end, they all have to take responsibility for what they do or fail to do.The magnificent visuals of the Iguassu Falls and the moving score by Morricone (surely his best) all contribute to an unforgettable picture.\",\n",

At first glance The Mission is a story about a political struggle. Upon closer examination it is no less than divine revelation about the nature of the human heart.\",\n",
       " '\\'Variety\\' got it completely wrong when they called this film \\\\\"sorrowfully mediocre\\\\\" and \\\\\"sluggishly staged\\\\\". For in all honesty The Name of the Rose is one of the greatest films of the \\'80s, and a film that grows in greatness every time you revisit it. Based on a major bestselling novel by Umberto Eco, the film is an excellent murder mystery further heightened by its authentic period trappings and a clutch of tremendous performances.Brother William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his young apprentice Adso (Christian Slater) are monks who arrive in a 14th Century monastery having been summoned for a religious conference. Soon after their arrival, a series of bloodthirsty murders take place and the friars still alive begin to fear that either the Apocalypse is upon them, or a highly disturbed individual is out to bump them off. Brother William has a penchant for sleuthing, so he probes into the mysterious deaths and discovers that each victim had laid his eyes upon a Greek manuscript hidden deep within the interior of the monastery. He gradually realises that the killer must be targeting those who know of the book\\'s existence, but just as he is about to solve the killings an inquisitor (F. Murray Abraham) arrives and tries to discredit Brother William\\'s theories, preferring to blame the crimes on non-existent heretics and satanists.The film is very realistic in every way - the cold, uncomfortable monastery; the graphic murders; grotesque and disfigured characters; a startlingly explicit sex scene; authentic-sounding dialogue; excellent indoor and outdoor locations; and well-researched costume designs. Furthermore, it is a superbly paced film, never in too great a hurry to unravel but never so slow that it becomes a plod. Connery is great as the hero, surpassed only by Abraham in a breathtaking role as Bernardo Gui the inquisitor, and Slater does well considering his tender age as the loyal apprentice. Both Roy Scheider and Michael Caine were short-listed for the Connery role, but I don\\'t see how either actor could\\'ve done better with the character. Jean Jacques Annaud directs outstandingly, capturing every shadow, every expression and every plot piece with the eye that only a director obsessed with his material possibly can. The Name of the Rose makes the top #50 of the 1980s without question.',\n",
       " 'A murder mystery set in a medieval monastery, this film manages to be intriguing, amusing, thrilling and terrifying.It was adapted from the first novel by the Italian semiotician Umberto Eco, a book concerned with the monopolization of knowledge.  Eco approached this subject by concocting a series of mysterious deaths that occur in an isolated monastery, which eventually prove to revolve around a small coterie of disobedient monks who are partaking of a forbidden book.  This leads to the discovery of the monastery\\'s great secret, a vast hidden library where the knowledge of the ages is being allowed to rot away by authorities who hoard the books on the paternalistic justification that the knowledge they contain is too dangerous for ordinary people to possess.  The library is a vast maze, and being lost in it is one of the novel\\'s central episodes. (The maze theme, and particularly the library-as-maze, is one Eco shares with Jorge Luis Borges, and it feels here almost like the baton passed from one marathon-runner to the next.)    It is a novel filled with the love of books themselves, and dressed in a stunning evocation of one of the bleakest periods in the intellectual history of the last 2000 years.Jean Jacques Annaud\\'s masterful adaptation of this book wisely retains some of the novel\\'s elements, and transmutes others into terms far better suited to the medium of film.  Annaud creates the milieu of the monastery, bleak, dank, claustrophobic, almost drained of life, brilliantly.  (This film is the only way I\\'d ever want to visit a 13th century monastery.)  The suppression of individualism that is part and parcel of this monastic life is the obvious outward expression of the mindset that would suppress the product of centuries of human thought and writing.  Into it he brings William of Baskerville, excellently cast and wonderfully played by Sean Connery... a man who appears to be a monk solely because it is the only occupation in which he had the opportunity to study and exercise his mind. An obvious pre-cursor to Sherlock Holmes, William believes his eyes and ears, even when they contradict doctrine and the Official Line.  He is brought in by the Abbott to explain deaths and quiet the rumors... before the impending visit of a notoriously ruthless official of the Inquisition. To the Abbott\\'s great dismay, William dismisses an easy explanation and instead seeks to unravel the mystery.  And coming ever closer is hovering threat of The Inquisition, which is eventually embodied on screen by the sinister F. Murray Abraham.Where Annaud\\'s film departs from the novel is in shifting the emphasis away from \\\\\"the suppression of books\\\\\" as the central theme.  It remains a powerful symbol, but it is not required to stand on its own for the idea behind it. It is touched on in a wonderful scene where William first enters the library/maze and realizes what\\'s hidden there, books he\\'s heard legends of and longed to read his whole life, and he becomes totally giddy with the joy of this discovery.  But the seduction of the maze, the high-point of the novel, is a distinctly literary effect, and Annaud and his writers shrewdly perceived that it would be rather flat on screen.Instead, they center on the suppression of Free Thinking by the Inquisition, and the ruthless forms of terrorism employed to intimidate the \\\\\"useful\\\\\" minds into staying in their place, and thinking only what they are told. The human drama of the flames of the Inquisition \\\\\"read\\\\\" far more effectively on film than the intellectual drama of the imprisoned books, and that is driving force that makes the film, in its own medium, every bit as effective as the book.In all, this film is an entertainment for the mind as well as the senses, filled with remarkable performances an indelible visions.',\n",
       " \"If you like movies to send you back to another historical period, there are few which can do it more effectively than this one. The period is pre-enlightenment when the only books in the land (Italy) are owned by the different denominations of the Catholic faith. Inquisitions are the order of the day and the atmosphere of mistrust and misrepresentation which accompany such a fragile state, is expertly realised.Enter Sean Connery playing a Sherlock Holmes (`\\\\u0085Elementary my dear Wat-shun\\\\u0085') from the dark/middle ages, replete with a magnifying glass of sorts and a recognisable system of logical deduction. The story is a fine balance of complexity (easy enough to follow, but not too simplistic) with the inclusion of a number of sub-plots to keep it all ticking along nicely. The acting is very good but what makes it stand out is its evocation of another era, which is reproduced with authority. Highly enjoyable.\",\n",

       " 'PRETTY IN PINK is the tale of an original, but slightly outcast, girl named Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) who is from the poorer part of her town. She never minded this until one day when the rich, \\\\\"preppy\\\\\" Blane McDonnagh (Andrew McCarthy) asks her if she\\'d like to go out sometime. All of Blane\\'s rich preppy friends immediately disapprove, and Andie gets caught in the middle when her own best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer) disapproves as well. Andie decides to go out with Blane anyway, although their first date ends up being somewhat of a disaster. Blane takes Andie to his friend Steff\\'s (James Spader) house party, where nearly everyone snubs her, and Andie is embarrassed to let Blane see where she lives and what kind of house it is. In the end, Andie has to decide whether pursuing potential love is worth the humiliation she receives from everyone else for doing so.PRETTY IN PINK is the last of the three famous Molly Ringwald-John Hughes collaborations, and is also the least favorable, in my opinion. Which is not to say that it\\'s not a good movie, though. While its two predecessors dealt more with status and popularity issues, this movie deals with a more serious topic of class differences. However, I find this to be a pretty unrealistic scenario by today\\'s standards and not very easy to relate to, in my case at least. However, the whole concept of two lovers dating despite their differences and everyone else\\'s disapproval is pretty cool and receives my commendation. The ending, though, is a bit of a disappointment.What I really commend the movie on, however, is its portrayal of what love is really like. It manages to show just how beautiful it can be at times, and just how destructive it is most of the time. Having experienced something similar to Andie\\'s struggle, I have to say that that feature of the movie made it a lot more personable and relatable for me, taking on a deeper meaning than it probably would for others who haven\\'t experienced such a battle.As far as technical aspects go... well, what can you say. The acting is terrific, namely from the always-great Molly Ringwald and the spectacularly wacky Jon Cryer as the film\\'s most memorable character by far, Duckie. Jon Cryer easily delivers the film\\'s best performance, along with most of its best lines. Annie Potts is also wonderful and funny as Andie\\'s coworker Iona. John Hughes was a great director, even though his area of expertise was \\'80s teen movies--but, let\\'s face it, no one could have done them better.To wrap it up, PRETTY IN PINK is a cute love story with fantastic acting and characters that manages to capture a bit of the true essence of love, even if it is a bit disappointing in the end. 7/10.',\n",

This film is wonderfully life-affirming through the character of robot Jonny 5 (the scene where he realises what it means to be alive through crushing a grass hopper is beautifully portrayed), Ally Sheedy brings a bucket load of positive energy to the character of the naive but loving Stephanie, and to top it all there is a subtle but powerful comment on American militarism. There is a real emphasis on quality screen writing here which only comes through on a small ratio of films. The characters could easily have become 2 dimensional stereotypes, but instead given some interesting dialogue and motives (science, military etc).

People working together, eating together, striving together, and accomplishing together.The script is flawless. Every scene blends into the next, and takes you someplace new.

The director sees all his characters as victims of war rather than heroes or villains. Have a closer look at \\'em.Taylor has no power inside himself and is torn between the two fathers; he ends up with a physical act of revenge. This is not what one father taught him - and the other father is actually murdered by him. Sgt. Barnes would never fit the postwar life and knew it damn too well himself; after all, he is not a fool although might seem a senseless killing machine at first sight. Vietnamese bullets could not kill him, his talent for survival being his enemy. So, he attempts kinda suicide twice (at least) begging others to kill him and thus end the pain tearing him from inside: first, in the potheads\\' bunker scene after Taylor\\'s accusations; then, when Taylor finds him in the final scene.Sgt. Elias was far too good to survive the Nam and maybe even challenged and annoyed lifers on purpose, waiting for some bob barnes to hit back :) It\\'s a pity Stone excluded the stars\\' scene monologue which explains pretty much about Elias\\' ways and view of the future. In fact, for himself he sees no future. Not in this world that is all about betrayal and killing.Bunny and Junior, one the embodiment of somewhat sadistic bravery and the other of cowardice. Their deaths are partly a morality, partly to show that it does not matter if you\\'re black or white, brave or cowardly, war makes no difference wiping off everyone it can. King, Big Harold, Francis are survivors yet victims, too. What is awaiting them in the \\\\\"real\\\\\" world where nobody understands and nobody respects anything? They are dreaming of a comeback to music, girlfriends, fun time - but reality bites, and who knows, will they find their spot under the sun or will be forced to use the skills obtained in the Nam and get engaged in crime and drug abuse?Red O\\'Neill talking about his ability to predict if a guy is gonna make it or not. A reflection of his own fears: shall I stay alive and get out of here or not. The odds are that he is not, and Stone nails him to the place with Captain\\'s order to take over what was once the Platoon... Bye Patsy.The idea that Stone has been trying to bring forward to us is NOT (to my mind) a story of struggle between the good and the bad for the possession of Taylor\\'s soul (remember, the boy became a murderer in the end), but: where is war there can be no escape.

Of course I was fascinated after watching the movie and I remember I was that close to cry. I can definitely say Platoon is one of the best war movies of the history. It has many incredible scenes and it reserves a great story of brotherhood inside also vandalism and senseless of war. Charlie Sheen , William Dafoe and the great Tom Berenger can easily be considered as one the best combination of actors to tell a story of faith and betrayal in a movie. Oliver Stone did a great job as writer and director. I remember that I was really touched with the letters that Taylor ( Charlie Sheen ) writes to his grandma. Also with the amazing music of the film you feel many different things. I believe that on the last scene the picture of William Dafoe with his hands open on his knees with hundreds Viet Congs coming after him is a masterpiece work and unforgettable.I watched this movie at Osmanbey Gazi movie theater at Osmanbey-Istanbul and \\\\u0131 believe 70's and 80's are the best time in Istanbul for watching a movie with big saloons and with great atmosphere. With 90's big movie theaters started to turn to couple of small saloons and with shopping malls movie theaters started to locate at malls. I really miss a lot of 80's and the taste I get from the legend movie theaters like Osmanbey Site-Sisli Kent-Osmanbey Gazi- Pangalt\\\\u0131 Inci-Harbiye Konak and Harbiye As.\",\n",
       " 'Platoon is a must see for any fan of war movies. The film that put Stone on the map, Platoon is considered by Vietnam Vets as the most realistic (my father having been one of them). But in keeping the maxim of giving credit where credit is due, much of the success of Platoon belongs to military adviser Captain Dale Dye, who has been linked to pretty much every great war movie in the last twenty years. Much accolades to Tom Berenger as well, whose performance as Sgt. Barnes is the tour de force of his career (the scene in the village towards the end of the movie is brutal, befitting the character). With a great script, great performances, and awesome cinematography, Platoon is a surefire classic.',\n",

This movie totally impressed me!I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly. But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality.Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and hearing) the movie the way it originally was.\",\n",

Although growing up is tough, the friends you have at a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life. Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable.

The boys go on a trip to look for the body, about 30 miles away. There are some little problems on the way, including another gang with its leader Kiefer Sutherland. One of the boys thinks about his late brother because of the recent events, played by John Cusack.

       " \"Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejt\\\\u00f6) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.4/4\",\n",

The Sci-fi perspective doesn't overwhelm the overall plot, and vice versa.Very few B grade movies from this time period were watchable, much less worth keeping in one's collection.

Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master.\",\n",

Well, add my name to the list of admirers.Here's a low-grade sci-fi/crime story that is amazingly entertaining. It's a fast- paced account of normal people taking turns being inhabited by an alien being and suddenly turning into out-of-control killing machines. It guess it kind of sounds dumb, but seeing it is better than describing it. The characters in here are wild.Kyle MacLachlan plays his normal mid-80s strange character, a la Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, etc. Here, he is the FBI agent....or is he?On the first viewing I found Michael Nouri's role as too abrasive, taking away from some of the fun of viewing this, but, in future viewings he was more tolerable. What also helps this film is a little bit of humor thrown in here and there. It will probably wind up as a cult classic.\",\n",
       " 'This is one of the sickest and most depraved horror films of its time, and I love every minute of it. Where other films had only touched on the barest suggestion of the link between sex and death, Hellraiser shoves that fact right in your face.Frank Cotton (who starts out the film as the main character) is a soulless man who lives only for life\\'s pleasures. He will go to great lengths to satisfy his lusts, and thinks nothing of who he may be stepping on to get there. He is offered a small, strange puzzle box called The Lament Configuration by a strange man in what looks and sounds to be a Mid Eastern market. The box, he is promised, will open the gates to a world of pleasures that no mortal can possibly imagine. Frank takes the box, but he doesn\\'t understand that the pleasures the box offers are to the demons who live within it. The Cenobites, sadomasochistic creatures who live eternally beyond the gates that the box can open and close, take great pleasure in ensnaring new human victims to toy with, imprisoning them forever in a labyrinth of pain and suffering. Frank disappears, and many months later, his brother and sister-in-law come to live in the abandoned home.The film then switches gears and gives us a new main character: Julia. Julia, the wife of Frank Cottons brother Larry, is a cold woman. Beautiful and immaculate, she is icy and distant and seems to derive no pleasure from anything, least of all her husband and his daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty. Julia\\'s only private joy are the memories she has of Frank, with whom she once had an affair. Frank seems to be the only man who was never intimidated by Julia, treating her roughly and breaking down her defenses. Little does Julia know that Frank never left the house; he is upstairs, in the attic, having escaped from the Cenobites and now biding his time until he can return to a world of flesh and blood. When Larry accidentally injures himself and bleeds on the floor of the attic, Frank is brought back, feeding on the fluid and slowly regenerating, growing back bones, muscle and skin. Julia soon discovers the terrible secret in the attic. After her initial shock and disgust, she agrees to help Frank, for whom she still lusts, and begins bringing him men she picks up in bars. She bludgeons them to death and Frank feeds on them, each one helping him in his regeneration.The film then switches points of view once more and Kirsty becomes the main character. Kirsty, who has never liked the pretentious, frigid Julia, becomes suspicious. Her suspicions are soon confirmed when she comes face to face with \\\\\"Uncle Frank\\\\\" and barely escapes his bloody clutches, the Lament Configuration in her hand. She accidentally opens it, and when the demons within, led by the now-famous Pinhead, threaten to take her back with them to their dimension, she makes a deal: she will lead them to Frank, and they can have him instead of her. From there on out, it is a countdown; will Kirsty find Frank in time? Can her father be saved from the adulterous couple plotting against him in his own house? Or will it be too late for all of them?This is another sex-equals-death film, but with a slightly updated feel. Julia is Bad; she cheats on her husband and likes her sex rough. Kirsty is Good, but she is no virgin, living with her boyfriend and eagerly engaging in premarital sex. Larry, a dull-as-paste husband who seems to genuinely love his wife but doesn\\'t quite understand how to treat a woman, falls victim to his own blandness. He never sees what\\'s coming because he possesses no imagination, no foresight; he is just the everyday, mundane man mowed under by his own unspectacular existence. Frank is the ultimate Bad; he is a user. He likes sadism, but not when it is turned on him. The Cenobites are the real reason this film was so successful; expressionless zombies in black leather and fetish wear. Led by the majestic Pinhead, they come into our world equipped with chains and hooks and all manner of painful devices, literally ripping their victims apart without batting an eye. They are what Frank wants to be, but Frank is not strong enough. He collapses beneath the weight of his own ego; he wants to think he is a god, but he is only an insect after all.This film received an X rating when it was first released, but seems pretty tame now. The gore effects are only a tad dated, but they\\'re still quite shocking. I think the X rating might have been due more to the films unrelenting sadism than anything else. It\\'s sick and remorseless, but that\\'s not to say it\\'s bad. It\\'s innovative. Nothing like it had been seen up to that time, and it still remains an original. It never imitates; it\\'s all fresh and frighteningly new and should be appreciated for that if nothing else.

All the songs that these two, Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, sing are written by Elaine May and I found them to be simply hysterical.

It has a genuine 80's look and feel, as well as an awesome soundtrack and some fantastic performances by 80's legends like Corey Feldman.This movie really draws you into it and makes you feel like you're right there in Santa Carla. The music fits the film perfectly. Nothing would have worked better. The setting is perfect. If you were a vampire and you were never going to die, where else would you want to spend your time? The amusement park, the abandoned cave with all that great stuff in it, and the railroad tracks (trust me, you'll understand after you see it) are absolutely incredible. The way Joel Schumacher uses certain POV shots and the eerie fog only add to the mood and atmosphere of the movie.The gore and special effects are great! Since this is an 80's movie, there is no CGI thankfully, so everything you see is really real. The make-up of the vampires is excellent with their piercing eyes and long fangs. The gore doesn't really show itself until the end, though there is a very bloody (but quick) campfire attack in the middle. Once we do get to the blood and guts, it's great! There's a melting vampire in holy water, an exploding vampire, two excellent impalings, and more where that came from.Finally, the acting is great. We have a very good cast, especially Kiefer Sutherland, who puts everyone else to shame. Jason Patric is a little dry, but he's great in his role. Max and Lucy have good chemistry, as well as Star and Michael. The Frog Brothers are classic and are responsible for most of the humor.

She is a bad ass! I love everything about this film everything and I love it to death!:P \\\\\"Welcome to Prime time, Bitch!\\\\\"This was a MAJOR improvement over the disaster part 2, The Gore FX were excellent and the story was well written. It\\'s too bad Nancy was killed off it would have been nice to see her in future sequels. I love this horror slasher film to death it is very imaginative, entertaining, a good set of characters, some fun catchphrases/dialogue, a great Dokken song aka Dream Warriors...a lot of awesome stuff is in this one. Why I love this film? Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returns which you already know I love the main heroine so much in the series franchise. John Saxon also returns as Det. Donald Thompson. Wes Craven is back as writer in this film, the movie is a little longer than the first and the second film. This is Patricia Arquette\\'s first movie. In my opinion it is her first best movie alongside with Stigmata (1999) in other films she made were just awful or some sucked! Anyway I love Patricia Arquette here: She\\'s beautiful, vibrant and has so much emotion in her lovely eyes. A really essential female lead for a film this big. This is how you correctly make a sequel. This one really felt like \\\\\"Part 2\\\\\" to me because of the continuation from the 1st movie. The hospital setting fit the theme perfectly and this one contains one of my favorite death scenes in the whole series. Also, 80\\'s band Dokken recorded a few songs for the movie which is another reason why this is a must-see for Nightmare fans.Chuck Russell is one of my favorite directors he directed The Mask (1994) with Jim Carrey that I love, Eraser with Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Blob (1988) a year later which I also love so much. I think he made great choose of casting the actors alongside with Wes Craven the idea and imaginative of the film flick were just really awesome, how they scramble in to making a movie! Robert England is pure gold in this film, seriously I just love his imaginative and portrayal of Freddy Krueger in this film! The man is the main legend as the villain in the series!, It has a cool premise and I really enjoy The characters. To me this is the 1st best horror sequel ever made after A Nightmare on Elm Street which is the second favorite one in the franchise. I Love this film so much.I only have one major problem with the film and that is Nancy dies on the end of the film here. Even tough she dies, the death scene was awesome because it was honorable death! She stopped Freddy for hurting anyone else and Kristen Parker. The death scene was honorable to me because Kristen ( Patricia Arquette) was crying over her death and just love how Kristen showed how of a heart she has and that she is a good wonderful person and a human been. Wes Craven did not wanted to kill Nancy off. He did not like the idea that they killed her off! Jason Saxon as Donald Thompson is also killed by the end of the film which that shouldn\\'t be in here also! The idea for local psychiatric hospital for teens in this film was just very brilliant and very imaginative praise to Wes Craven. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) who invades the minds of a new group of teens -- and the nightmares begin again. Local teenagers start dying and only Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) knows the truth. Now a doctor at the local psychiatric hospital, she is the lone survivor of one of Freddy\\'s previous killing sprees. Now, it\\'s a fight against her co-workers\\' disbelief and a race against time to stop Freddy before he kills again. That\\'s your basic plot. It does involve travel and invading in to the minds of a teen\\'s dreams. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval',\n",
       " 'For Georgian Cinema, every film of T.Abuladze was a landmark. Each project was at least the most typical if not the best film of its time. Visually they all are made in different style and form defined by  (or sometimes defining) the trends in the contemporary Georgian cinema. (spoilers ahead !).The major achievement of Tengiz Abuladze himself is a trilogy The Plead, Tree of Wishes and Repentance. These films got a wide critical acclaim and Repentance even became the major hit in USSR. Many Soviet and Post-Soviet Critics and viewers consider it to be the best Soviet film of 80-ies. The phrases and notions from this film became proverbs and are quoted everywhere, general concepts \\\\\"Repentance\\\\\" and \\\\\"the Way to the Temple\\\\\" where over-abused by soviet media for over a decade. But... some foreign critics were much less agitated by the film. Leonard Maltin even found it boring (while in USSR the film was often criticized for being too entertaining !!!). On the contrary film by Nikita Mikhalkhov on a similar subject - \\\\\"Burnt by the Sun\\\\\" was very well received in the west, while in former USSR it was simply excoriated by critics as a shallow Hollywood-oriented Soap and a definite cash-in on the glory of Repentance.  Some foreign critics and viewers didn\\'t understand anything about the Repentance (which is full of symbols and allusions, some of them are uniquely Georgian.) apart from the Stalin criticism. Here are some facts about the film that foreigners mostly do not know.1. The story- is a real one - Beria (the darkest evil character of Stalin epoque crushed  a well-known painter after he attempted to protect the Metechi Temple (a trade mark of Tbilisi-capital of Georgia), that Beria planned to destroy to build some monument. As always everyone who opposed Beria were arrested and mostly executed. But the Temple- symbol of spirituality, human values, heart of a nation survived.2. Due to this the prologue and epilogue of the film are very important - (by the way there are 2 time periods in the film- the Past - Stalin Time, totalitarian regime, the Present - Brejnev Period, so called Zastoi (standstill, stagnation period) - time of conformism when everything became seemingly all right)- so the prologue and epilogue is the picture of the soviet Zastoi of 70-ies- everything seems to be all right and a child of family destroyed by totalitarian regime makes cakes with beautiful but fake temples on them, eventually the cake is eaten be a dirty little bearded man admiring the totalitarian past and speaking about Varlam Aravidze (read Stalin, Beria and all other  monsters from the Past) with admiration, and the cake-maker (the victim of Varlam) says nothing and just imagines what could she do to remind people of truth. But this is just her imagination, people are conformists they need no truth and only old vagabond woman searches for the Way to the Tample.3. The Axis of the film is Aravidze family (Aravidze in Georgian means Nobody\\'s Son): we see 3 generations- Varlam - (the totalitarian past), his son Abel and His Wife- (the \\\\\"innocent\\\\\" conformist Present,) and Tornike- the Grandson (the future that finally must take the responsibility for the crimes of past)4. But this \\\\\" taking the responsibility for the crimes of past\\\\\" is a controversial issue that\\'s why everything happens only in the imagination of the cake-maker- becouse the degree and a form of repentance, and the repentance itself is a very complex and painful matter; and yes, the Skeleton in the Closet affects and punishes not Varlam who commits the crime but Abel who tries to hush it up and Tornike who is among few really \\\\\"innocent\\\\\" characters of the film. Digging out the corpse of Varlam (the Past) - is this a solution? The authors leave the question to the viewers.5. Some scenes need explanation:The funeral may look grotesque, but in fact its pretty realistic and is more a humoristic critique of Georgian obsession with ceremonies Georgian Cemeteries are really the monuments of human vanity - huge, with excessive use of marble, granites and other materials. Putting cage on the grave of Varlam is symbolic, but in general the episode depicts how unholy the sacred places   have become in Soviet Union (Georgia), the episode with church shows the same - the church is transformed into Power Station. Episode in the greenhouse is a Naked Gun-like literal depiction of the expression \\\\\"Under the Cap\\\\\"(to have someone under control). During his \\\\\"Inauguration Speech\\\\\" Varlam makes  a statement that became quintessential when depicting Stalin regime. He cites Confucius \\\\\" It\\'s hard to catch cat in the dark room, especially if it is not there\\\\\" and paraphrases it \\\\\"We Will Catch the Cat in the Dark Room, Even if It\\'s not There\\\\\". For those who have little idea of Stalinism the accusation for \\\\\"making a tunnel from Bombay to London \\\\\" may sound forced but in fact its very realistic and sounds rather tame next to some other accusations based on which millions of people were killed. Episode with Goddess of Justice has dual symbolism: First, the goddess has become a lady of dubious reputation playing piano with a stalinistic prosecutor, second, the actress making cameo appearance here appeared in the first part of  the trilogy as well (the Plea) there she was a symbol of beauty and purity.6. The cast is \\\\\"all star\\\\\" (of Georgian cinema of course). Many viewers even didn\\'t noticed that father and son- Varlam and Abel are acted by the same actor !!! The old lady at the end of the film looking for a temple, is last screen appearance of Veriko Anjaparidze, perhaps the greatest Georgian actress. By the way her character is obvious \\\\\"older\\\\\" Pupala from the \\\\\"Tree of Wishes\\\\\", there this character was acted by S. Chiaureli -daughter of Veriko.',\n",
       " \"I'm not sure who is responsible for bringing Steve Martin and John Candy together,but they are a genius in my book,and they were brought together with just the right material.This comedy from John Hughes is without question his best work as a director. I look at this film as a modern day Laurel and Hardy romp,which, incredibly was not included in the AFI's Top 100 comedies.It will cause you tears,both from laughter and it's touching ending.It is about two very different ways of life,clashing in the beginning, but slowly coming together from the realization they we are all human,despite our differences.It is becoming a tradition at the Williams household to view this movie every Thanksgiving.It is a must see,must own film. Thumbs up.\",\n",

Here we have several scientists and students trying, not only to prove that the Devil exists, but that they have him trapped in a jar in a church basement.The movie is so full of sub-atomic theory that you would swear it was written by Michio Kaku, not John Carpenter. (Yeah, don't let the credits fool you. Carpenter wrote this film under a pseudonym)Took my girlfriend to see this when it came out. She's now my wife and to this day, she's still a little afraid of mirrors because of this film.Loved it.\",\n",
       " 'The filmmakers did an incredible job of bringing E.M. Forster\\'s touching novel to life -- and I suspect that was no easy task because so much of the novel involves the main character\\'s innermost thoughts and feelings. However, Merchant and Ivory did a beautiful job conveying the loneliness, fear and desperation of the main character, Maurice Hall.\\\\nThe movie follows Maurice (James Wilby) down his road of self-discovery; from his embarrassing teen years to Cambridge (where he gets his first exhilarating taste of love) to his post-collegiate years as a young man struggling to come to terms with his sexuality in a time when homosexuals were mercilessly persecuted.The movie is also very much about class struggle. Maurice is a gentleman born and bred, with a penchant for snobbery. As he comes to terms with his sexuality, he is forced to deal with differences in class when he realizes he is in love with someone from the serving class.Readers of the novel will be delighted as much of the wonderful dialogue from the book appears in the film.The characters were perfectly cast, with Hugh Grant (before he was a mega star) as Clive Durham, the perfect young gentleman from Cambridge (and Maurice\\'s first love), Rupert Graves as the smoldering, lower class hunk who wins Maurice\\'s heart, and Ben Kingsley in a hilarious turn as Maurice\\'s junk-psychologist. James Wilby was spot-on in the title role and he perfectly captures the isolation, sadness and ultimate joy of the conflicted Maurice.\\\\\"Maurice\\\\\" is a touching love story that anyone -- straight or gay -- can enjoy. Romance knows neither of these terms. And, the movie *is* unabashedly romantic and optimistic -- your heart will soar when Maurice finally gives in, casts societal conventions aside and visits his beloved at the boathouse. The hopeful ending is inspiring, though the close-up of Clive at the window at the end of the movie will break your heart.\\\\nBeautifully filmed, superbly acted -- a must-see film.',\n",
       " \"This film is an intelligent, sardonic send up of several genres that pokes fun (affectionately)\\xa0at fairy tales, swashbucklers, love stories and basic conventions of film.  One of my favorite scenes is where Inigo Montoya first confronts his quarry after years of searching.  His adversary does the unexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the same circumstances, with hilarious results in the scene.  Basil Rathbone probably whirled in his grave!Not by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but a champ in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and good performances.  Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales that it spoofs than even the best of Disney's takes.  I loved it the first time I saw it and love it more now.  Well worth watching.  Recommended.\",\n",
       " \"I love this movie!  It's sweet, but with satirical humor. The dialogue is great and the adventure scenes are fun.  Rob Reiner shows an excellent touch once again with comedy and a childlike point of view.  It manages to be whimsical romantic while laughing at the conventions of the fairy tale genre. I would recommend it to just about anyone. I've seen it several times, and I'm always happy to see it again whenever I have a friend who hasn't seen it yet. I haven't watched it with any kids, but I think it has lots for them too. There are wonderful quotes throughout.  I think Mandy Patinkin absolutely steals the scenes he is in as the Spaniard Inigo Montoya, bent on avenging his father's death. I gave it 8 out of 10 mainly because it feels very light, but I may go back and change to 9 thinking of how happy this movie makes me and it's rewatchability.\",\n",

This has to be the worst acting I've seen in my life....totally laughable and amateurish to say the least. Let me say it one more time so no one else wastes their valuable time on this pile of putrid crap. The acting was laughable and amateurish, the storyline was old and unoriginal.

I guess it takes a woman who can actually take care of herself instead of waiting for Prince Charming to get this. I can\\'t tell you how anti female this movie is. If you think women are just window dressing for male revenge and hero fantasies this is the flick for you. If you think women can actually think and act for themselves and not sit around forever to wait to be rescued, give this a pass.',\n",
       " 'The success of this movie can be credited to one man; Paul Verhoeven. His special touch of violence, gore and social satire make the movie more than just your average B-movie, with a lame title and simple story and characters. Yes, without Verhoeven this movie seriously would had been nothing more like another B-movie on par with science-fiction/action movies like \\\\\"Timecop\\\\\" and Albert Pyun movies.The main story of \\\\\"RoboCop\\\\\" itself is simply and not that complex, however Verhoeven manages to put many different layers for the story as well as the characters in the movie. The social satire in the movie works out brilliantly and is what makes the movie perhaps more entertaining than thrilling or tense. Especially those typical Verhoeven news sketches are brilliant! But also those who will not be able to understand or fully appreciate the social satire elements in the movie, will have plenty to enjoy while watching this. The action itself is top-class and the characters are fun as well as cool. RoboCop himself looks awesome, both in his movements and the way his costume looks. Oh and of course I may not forget his awesome gun!The movie is not only filled with some typical Verhoeven social satire elements but also with some trademark Verhoeven gore and violence. The way Murphy gets killed is very graphic and disturbing. But as always in most Verhoeven movies is the case, the violence is so over-the-top that it\\'s not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it\\'s just so over-the-top. Especially what happens to Emil at the end, the gore is way over-the-top there and I absolutely love it!In a movie like this the characters are also always important. Especially the villains and yes, \\\\\"RoboCop\\\\\" has some highly entertaining and good villains. The group of Clarence, Leon, Joe and Steve are a bunch of entertaining, charismatic stereotypical villains. But also the more educated villains like Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) and Bob Morton (a very young Miguel Ferrer) who also isn\\'t a very nice person. But also the mechanical villain ED-209 is extremely cool and dangerous looking. The stop-motion effects for him are of course heavily outdated this days but it takes away nothing of his threatening appearance. All of the character are entertaining and well developed. Characters also worth mentioning are The Old Man (Dan O\\'Herlihy) who plays the president of OCP and you can tell by his face gestures that he\\'s not very pleased with the direction Dick Jones is heading towards with the company and Johnson who is always smiling. And of course let\\'s not forget Bixby \\\\\"I\\'d buy that for a dollar!\\\\\" Snyder, he\\'s a real classic! They should given that guy a real show on TV.Also the musical score by Basil Poledouris is what helps to make this movie a very memorable one. Poledouris delivers one of his best works. When will he finally get some more attention from the big awards? He has made some great stuff but he rarely has won anything of importance with it. A bit of a disgrace for such a wonderful composer.All in all this is a brilliantly entertaining science-fiction/action movie that simply is perfect in every way, mainly thanks to Verhoeven his input.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/',\n",
       " 'When I first saw \\\\\"Robocop\\\\\" on Showtime back in 1989, I was about 8 years old. It was definitely the most violent, and one of the most sophisticated films I\\'d ever seen (at that time...being 8, my dad had issues with showing me \\\\\"Blade Runner\\\\\" though he seriously wanted me to since it was first released). Everything about the film grabbed me on some level. A lot of people seem to really like this film, though I\\'ve heard a share of people and critics say that it\\'s a second-rate film due to the extensive violence and sappy dialogue, calling it cartoon-ish. Well, I have to say that the cartoon-ish quality to the film is part of its allure. It\\'s not only a humorous device for the sake of entertainment, but its significance to the story is great. This is a dystopian future where big companies control almost every part of our existence, from the government to the police to our domestic lives. It\\'s almost Orwell-ian (anybody notice how the OCP building is the tallest in the city?). It\\'s a future where criminals run rampant in every form, from street thugs to business execs. Seriously, the head villain is a greedy business suit who uses a street gang to create trouble so he can provide a solution in the form of a droid with enough firepower to put up a fight with a tank...only to have that blow up in his face and mutilate a fellow exec at its unveiling. Bill Gates never had a bad day like this. Or how about when the gang blows Murphy into a million pieces with enough shotgun ammo to make even the NRA cringe, totally destroying any remnants of his right arm. It\\'s cartoon-ish because it\\'s a comentary on the direction the world could conceivably take, while at the same time being a source of entertainment. Whether the entertainment value was intended for people who love to see guns blazing or for people who like to see horrifying sights (Murphy\\'s execution, for as long as it was and as bloody as it was, HAD to demand a lot of sympathy from people...if it didn\\'t, there\\'s something wrong with you, and let\\'s not forget when Robocop was getting shot up by the swat team). This film has everything going for it. A plot that exists on more levels than its B-movie surface. It\\'s a social commentary, a satire, an action film, a sci-fi film, and at times even a comedy (when Robocop dragged the guy away by his hair, I laughed like mad). The acting is great, the effects are great (not perfect, but that adds to the visual appeal because it\\'s as gritty as the story), the music is great (kudos to Basil Poledouris on an amazing score), and overall...this film is one of the greatest films of its genre. I wouldn\\'t call it \\\\\"THE\\\\\" greatest, but it\\'s very high up there. I still have yet to see the uncut Director\\'s version, but knowing Paul Verhoeven\\'s work as I do, I know it must be far more brutal than the domestic version (hard to grasp with how far this film goes, but...it evidently went further, showing just how cartoon-ish things can get I suppose). I give it a definite 10/10!!!',\n",
       " \"Robocop is an unbelieveable experience. I haven't watched the film since 1988 and the other day I recieved it on DVD. So I eagerly popped it in the player and BOOM!!! The only way I can describe Robocop is ultraviolence. The film is so over the top and out of control. The film speaks of a future where big companies will run the governmental defense. Those times are upon us more and more everyday. Paul Verhoeven has made one of the most important science fiction films ever made and it's a brillant piece of cinema.\",\n",

Predator is Epic Sci-fi Action movie of the 80\\'s, my number 1 personal favorite best action sci-fi classic film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and the rest of his team are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator, that\\'s what makes this film and story more interesting than. This is very fast paced action flick, you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action Sci-Fi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. Is my number 1 Schwarzenegger best Action Sci-Fi Epic movie. The best action movie ever made! Major Alan \\\\\"Dutch\\\\\" Schaefer is my comic book hero this is my hero. The hunted becomes the hunter on the end of the film when he camouflage with mud to defend him self against the Predator-ultimate hunter and hunts him down by setting booby-traps for him the best! \\\\\"If it bleeds, we can kill it.\\\\\" In the remote jungle of a Central American country, an elite group of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer, embarks on a CIA mission to clear out a guerrilla stronghold and rescue the remaining hostages. However, the hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent, otherworldly being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch\\'s team. Possessing a chameleon like camouflaging ability and a deadly alien arsenal, the creature tracks down the soldiers one by one.This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it\\'s not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with an $98 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidia Carillo, Shane Black, Sonny Landham and Kevin Peter Hall they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let\\'s all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.Predator is the 1980\\'s most adrenaline-pumping, action-packed, violent mainstream film of the decade, a film replete with nearly non-stop action, loud, messy violence, huge muscles, big guns, and an extraterrestrial killing machine with infrared sight and a laser cannon on his shoulder thrown in for good measure. The film\\'s budget was around $15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12, 1987, where it grossed $59,735,548. Initial critical reaction was mixed; criticism focused on the thin plot.Predator is a 1987 American science-fiction action directed by John McTiernan.10/10 My all time favorite action film I love it to death it is my personal favorite action film of all time. Predator is a masterpiece, one of the best Sci-Fi action films of al time. I own the DVD and I also own the Blu-ray disc. I used to had ultimate hunter edition on Blu-ray but the subtitles were awful and the picture was lousy and wax like plastic. I sold it to someone that need it and I bought the original early release version on Blu-ray instead.',\n",
       " \"Predator is the classic action film.  What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved.  The genius of that!  The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end.  He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see.  Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy.  The whole cast worked very well together. \\\\nThe one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator.  The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius.  I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.  I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit.  I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) \\\\nPredator is evidence of how action films should be done.

I did laugh throughout, but I was also touched and found it quite sad (in a very entertaining way.)  I would like to think that this is what Bruce Robinson intended...to make a dramedy...not just a silly romp.  Though perhaps a bit slow for some, I thought the pace was remarkable, the acting superb.  I have also heard people say that they found the plot lacking...but I argue that sometimes it\\'s just nice to sit back and get swept away by a good character study.

That's the key - it's all too credible, 'cos we've done it. As an essay on the final shedding of a strange inverted innocence for the corruption of 'normal' life with its compromises, self-discipline and grind, unsurpassed, I believe. Likewise for its appreciation of the deep platonic love that can spring up between young men in the trenches of poverty and booze.

His sophomore effort shows the story of a married couple (the Maitlands played with good degree by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die accidentally off a bridge and wind up the target for a upper-class family (including a young yet well played Winona Ryder) and a weird yet scary ghost (with the most) named Beetleguise (or Beetlejuice in a scene of laughs) played to immense complexity by Michael Keaton. Sure this plot may sound a little anti-climactic being mainly gags and not really a focused story, but so what? In a film where you see sandworms from saturn, shrimps that attach after calypso and a nut who has seen the exorcist 167 time (insert quote here), why bother with a plot.

       " 'I\\'ve seen this brilliant horror movie over twenty times so far and it is still great.\\\\\"Child\\'s Play\\\\\" is wonderfully original-a great concept(the soul of a serial killer in the puppet)and villain(Chucky!)are perhaps the keys to it all.Plenty of shocks and scares,pretty good acting and lots of violence.The direction and editing are so tight and carefully done.Now I can see why this movie was such a huge success in 1988.Managing to be both frightening and classy,this is a nerve-wracking experience.I actually found \\\\\"Child\\'s Play\\\\\" to be a very scary film.I did not find it too gory,but what gore there is it was done to heighten intensity levels to the extreme.All in all,I wholeheartedly recommend it to any open-minded viewer,who likes to watch horror movies.The hammer in the head scene still gives me goosebumps.',\n",
       " \"Child's Play is built upon a pretty laughable premise \\\\u0096 some hardened criminal finds himself wounded and cornered by the police, so he chants some mystical words, lightning clouds form in the sky, and he transports his soul into the body of a kid's doll of the My Buddy variety. But the movie is so well made that it is able to remain effective despite its questionable premise, kind of like Darkman, another movie with something of a goofy plot but that still manages to come off as a great action horror film.Some of the best moments in the film come early on, before anyone but Andy realizes that Chucky is alive. Kind of like what Steven Spielberg did in Jaws, director Tom Holland leaves Chucky as a lifeless doll for a good portion of the beginning of the film. As is to be expected, it's much more difficult to show a living, running, stabbing, screaming doll than it is to show a regular doll, which itself manages to stare blankly in such a way that you know there's something going on in its head.There's nothing worse than hearing someone criticize the acting skills of a little kid, but I have to admit that I found Alex Vincent's performance as Andy a little trying at times. Granted, the kid deserves a lot of credit for performing reasonably well in a horror film at the age of 7, which is certainly more than I could have done at that age, but for every time that he effectively portrayed a scared little kid, which happened often, there were at least as many times when he spoke with the wooden monotone generally associated with reading a cue card.That being said, the effects in the movie are very impressive. There are a few goofs in there, but you have to look pretty hard to find them, and the doll itself was very well done. Brad Dourif makes one of his earlier appearances, showing up in Child's Play just long enough to get shot and then transfer his body into the doll, and then spend the rest of what is now a total of five movies trying to get out of it, which may have something to do with the fact that his voice is more famous than his face. He was mostly known as the timid Billy Bibbit from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest before he did Child's Play, and the success of this movie clearly had a significant impact on the rest of his career, since so many of his later performances were in decidedly dark roles.Note: watch for the only funny scene in the movie, which my itself is so funny that any other comic relief isn't even necessary. As Chucky ascends in an elevator, and elderly woman notices him, but her husband tells her to just leave it, whoever forgot it is bound to come back for it. When she exits the elevator, she looks back with a grimace and says, 'Ugly doll\\\\u0085' Chucky's response is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a horror film.\",\n",

Maybe that\\'s it, maybe there is something of Adrian in all of us, Colin Firth\\'s masterful performance, makes that uncomfortable assumption, pretty plausible. Someone who\\'s not at ease around other human beings, suddenly, for practical reasons, allows one into his life and becomes an addict.

       " 'The Age of Enlightment gave to the world some pretty controversial minds. At one end of the spectrum there was the Marquis de Sade who, no secret to anyone, created the concept that is now known as sadism. At the other end there is Choderlos de Laclos, who is widely known for creating this story which in essence is very close to Sade\\'s dark heart even when it never reaches the extremes of his florid depictions of ritualistic, sexual perversion.DANGEROUS LIAISONS, based on the novel \\\\\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\\\\", is this tale, Laclos\\' most known, adapted many times for television and screen, but never like this with such attention to detail to make it as French as possible, and bringing a classical sensibility to the front. Stephen Frears, in his American film debut, creates a lush visage of restrained yet swooning passions, icy stares, and hushed, measured speeches against the backdrop of the Ile-de-France and should have been the film of the year had it not been for the usual sentimentalism prevalent during the 1980\\'s which gave the major awards to RAINMAN, a film centered around autism that, while delicate as a subject matter was hardly dramatic and today is barely memorable.On the other hand, this story is. The dark comedy that pins two bored aristocrats against each other as they play God with other people\\'s lives without realizing the devastating consequences that will result from this has been the stuff of legend and allure. Glenn Close, John Malkovich, and Michelle Pfeiffer all are beyond awards in their exacting and multidimensional portrayals of three very different people caught in a web of deceit. However the star of this adaptation has to be Christopher Hampton who immortalizes Laclos\\' vision in a subtle, yet powerful story filled with subtext and restrained cruelty. He\\'s the one who suggests pages about his characters, most tellingly of the Marquis de Merteuil in three key scenes: in the first, opening sequence (which she also shares with the Vicomte de Valmont), she admires her reflection in a mirror with a smug expression akin to the Mona Lisa. She is in control and about to go through with her activities. She is dressed into an orgy of corsets and fabric, looking directly into the camera -- the Vicomte does the same as he is dressed -- which sets their characters\\' tones. They are mirror images of one another, each in their gender. Both are apparently, in full control.The second telling revelation of the Marquise is when she arrives to the Volanges\\' to give advice to Cecile about virtue. You can see how she has her Mona Lisa smile on, which as soon as she gets off her carriage turns to a rictus of anguish. Cut to her later saying about shame: \\\\\"You find the shame is like the pain. You only feel it once.\\\\\" As her head rests against a window you may see her eyes briefly moisten. Her expression is, however, blank, but very deep and expressive. It\\'s the first time she cracks open the door to her inner face, but just a little and only for a second, but what a second! The last time Hampton describes Merteuil is in a scene which mirrors the first scene: watch how again, she looks at herself in her mirror. Her traps have been discovered and she faces her own self and uncertain future, having destroyed everyone around her and being left alone. It\\'s the calm right before the taking of the Bastille, hence why the timing of the story has to be in the Eighteenth Century, right before the French Revolution. And in being so revealing while using expressions, Hampton creates the internal dialog that was the driving force behind the epistolary nature of the novel. His rendition of the Madame de Tourvel and Valmont are no less complex. Michelle Pfieffer, with minimal dialog and her wide, doe eyes, is given a rewarding role that explodes during her face-off with Malkovich when her character is betrayed. Their physicality skirts with sadism and sets the stage for Valmont\\'s own internal pain as he faces his own mortality, since he has been led to destroy the one he loves, and for a promise and nothing else.It\\'s been no mystery that films that lose to other, \\\\\"of the moment\\\\\" films become timeless and the stuff that makes movie magic. DANGEROUS LIAISONS, nearly twenty years later, still bites, especially when from a light comedy it becomes this horrific monster staring at us from the abyss, more so because of the exquisite cruelty that we cause to others in the name of reputation and vanity. And in that, the Marquise is right: vanity and love are incompatible. Just look at Valmont and you will see why.',\n",
       " 'I thought \\\\\"Possession\\\\\" was a brilliant feat of surreality, the absolutely dis-harmonic atmosphere in that film was amazing. So what about Diabel then? Does it deserve being lauded with praise? In my humble opinion, not at all. First of all, the story the filmmaker is trying to tell here is inanely boring in itself ( who f**king cares about the plight of the polish unless you happen to be polish yourself? ). Second it does not help masking it up in code and symbolic speech, does not make it more interesting to watch, just more pretentious. Third, the actors felt like no more than empty props, vacant carriers existing only as receptacles for the underlying message, spouting a pompous, quasi-philosophical dialog, displaying a never ending theatrical behavior which was nauseating. Last, but by no means least, the so called violence on display here was meek, nothing to write home about. In short, if you want an absolute bore-fest; a whole lot of screaming and pushing, flailing of arms and legs, and violence that your Christian grandmother safely could watch, then this is the film for you. What a bucket full of pretentious p**s!!!',\n",
       " 'Brief and simple: this movie is terrific entertainment! With its uniquely eccentric characters and delightfully absurd storyline, \\'A Fish Called Wanda\\\\\" unquestionably is one of the funniest films ever made. The exhilarating screenplay works on so many level (a diamond heist gone wrong, Brits vs. Americans, romantic comedy...) and the top-notch cast obviously had an excellent time doing this film-job. There\\'s not a dull moment throughout the entire movie and every sequence contains at least two or three hilarious moments. The humor is very over-the-top at times but, what the hell, it remains a joy to behold. The cast is nearly perfect with John Cleese, Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis at their absolute best. Still, there\\'s one actor who deserves extra praise for his role here and that\\'s Kevin Kline. His hyperactive, deranged and extravagant character Otto is one of the most brilliant roles in comedy cinema ever! His moves, grimaces and monologues will make you fall off your seat laughing.

       " 'When I watched this movie, I steeled myself for a traumatic experience, based on every review I\\'d ever read of it, which usually include phrases like \\\\\"don\\'t watch this if you\\'re suicidal.\\\\\" Instead, if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw, it would probably be \\'beautiful\\'.Certainly it was sad, and arguably depressing, but I\\'ve read this movie compared with \\'Saving Private Ryan\\'. That\\'s ridiculous. \\'Grave of the Fireflies\\' is gentle and poetic more often than it\\'s violent, and it\\'s remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. It simply tells a story : there\\'s very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics. Why would a story like this need such heavy-handed tactics?I\\'ve also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it\\'s revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead. I have a quite different view of that device.Firstly. the beginning of \\'Fireflies\\' is, for all intents and purposes, a \\'happy ending\\'. This is such a non-linear plot development that you could fail to notice it, and thereby only see the movie\\'s gloom. The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko\\'s hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie, this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena. The crucial thing here is that \\'Fireflies\\' isn\\'t _about_ tension. It tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know (a legitimate narrative approach), and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending. You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won\\'t undercuts you with real emotional power. You know the characters are going to die, but you hope things won\\'t be so bad in the meantime. It doesn\\'t take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives, which makes us all fireflies.Perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that it\\'s so damn honest. I mean that: it\\'s one of the most honest, artifice-free movies I\\'ve ever seen. It doesn\\'t even really try to ram an anti-war message down your throat there is very little overt violence, and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering, it\\'s never gratuitous, and it\\'s over quickly. Compare this with \\'Private Ryan\\', where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts, only to reach a conclusion which, after much blood and thunder, signifies very little.\\'Fireflies\\', OTOH, has far more beauty than gore. This is what really surprised me about it. Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn, tranquil rural or urban settings, with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal, almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.Perhaps best of all, Setsuko is one of the very, very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-old I\\'ve ever seen who actually _behaves_ like a four year old. I\\'m so sick of seeing preternaturally smart, sassy, sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko\\'s emotion and behaviors are _exactly_ right for a completely normal four year-old, and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy. Similarly, Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride, compassion and hubris which you\\'d expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it\\'s up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer\\'s advice, swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead, was a very bad one, but - hello, people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he\\'s actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation, who doesn\\'t miraculously save the day, because his best judgment just isn\\'t good enough.Of course, his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway. Who knows?Don\\'t go into the film expecting tension, drama or even a tirade against war. It\\'s a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth. If you think Japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls, this could be the film which changes your mind. It\\'s slow, poetic, beautiful and sad, and extraordinarily honest.I must be the only person who didn\\'t cry during this film (and I mean, I get choked up during some Disney movies). Yes, it is sad, but its beauty and honesty is what I\\'ll remember.NB: this review refers to the subtitled version of the film.',\n",

Their relationship is nothing short of beautiful and touching.And without spoiling anything I have to say that this film touched me in a way no other film has ever touched me in my adult life. One or two films have upset me and reduced me to watery eyes but Grave of the Fireflies had me in fits of sobbing despair. I was a mess! I'm talking total emotional breakdown. Couldn't talk without sobbing! One of the best films I have EVER seen, animated or not.\",\n",

The brother (spoiler alert) was irresponsible and didn't have to let his sister die. She could have lived with anyone. Why couldn't he find a job? I don't want to say that that deadbeat deserved to die, but he did. Is that supposed to be the moral? Indolence kills everyone you care about? This was a cheap film, banking on an attempt to decimate people emotionally. What would make anyone rate this high? Just because it makes you sad doesn't make it a good movie.

The idea of the fireflies, among other important symbols, should have been exploited more powerfully. The fireflies are actually treated as a mere element of the setting. Same reproach as regards the historical background.It is no hard a task to make a sad film if its main character is a child who eventually dies, nothing to be proud of. This movie is a piece of gratuitous cruelty and pointlessness. Too dark for kids, too childish for grown-ups.The short music clip passage after the death of the girl (when we see her happy, playing innocently and fading to transparency as a ghost) is ludicrous. Awful! It reminds me of the black &amp; white scenes in Baywatch to evoke happy remembrances. It is as though, at the end of the movie, they judged that its emotional impact was not sufficient and added this scene.',\n",

He kept on waiting for his father, lamenting his sad state of affairs, but in effect, not doing anything about it. Also, the voice of Setsuko really started to get on my nerves about twenty minutes into the movie. Oh, boohoo. The boy was so obviously in denial about everything, the death of his mother, no contact from his mother, his sick sister. I got quickly sick of this movie. To me, the stubbornness and denial of the boy character represented the Japanese Empire's attitude towards reality before, during and maybe even after the war. To that end, I felt no sympathy for the children.\",\n",

All serve to create such illusion. Plot is okay, if it's describing the Jews all other groups people, I would give it a higher rating. But for now, my prejudice play a major role, and I can't seem to get the premise out of the way when I'm watching it. I just don't understand, if they're aware of the gore and destructions a war brings, why start one in the first place? Or do they think the lives of people from others nations doesn't matter as much?

       " 'Well, I guess this is why movies are so personal to the viewer.I\\'ve read some of the other comments here and have seen words like \\\\\"condescending\\\\\" and \\\\\"mediocre.\\\\\"I couldn\\'t disagree more. \\\\\"Mississippi Burning\\\\\" is an intellectually challenging movie. It demands that you immerse yourself in the worst of southern culture, whether you like it or not.Based on a true story, the film takes place in 1964 (my birth year, incidentally) in a small town ugly and virulent with racism. The good ol\\' boy sheriff and his stoolies ambush and in cold blood murder three civil rights workers. The world\\'s a-changing, but the power-brokers in this place refuse to let that happen. They\\'ll do anything to prevent blacks from taking their rightful place at the table - literally.The FBI sends a couple of mismatched agents in to search for the three missing young men. One agent (Hackman) is \\'old school\\', sly, and knows his enemies a little too well. The other (Dafoe) is a naive Kennedy fire-eater, ready to bring the full force of the FBI and military down upon this small town\\'s head. Although he is easy to underestimate at first, he grows into his role, showing astonishing decisiveness and strength.The relationship between the town\\'s blacks and whites is complicated and fraught with rules - spoken and unspoken. It\\'s a not-so-secret secret that the civil rights workers have been murdered. Hackman and Dafoe just have to get the bodies and the evidence, that\\'s all. Fear and loathing prevent that from happening, until the wife of a deputy (the amazing Frances McDormand) throws herself on the fire and blows her slimy husband\\'s alibi.There is justice - of a sort - in the end. It\\'s not enough. Real change crawls on it\\'s belly in the south.\\\\\"Mississippi Burning\\\\\" is a movie of operatic gestures. The script is spongey with regional color and snappy, powerful dialogue.Hackman and McDormand are simply magical. They don\\'t take or make a false step from the first frame to the last. As she would go on to prove in later films, McDormand doesn\\'t just \\'play\\' a character - she IS that character. And Hackman is never more affecting that in this film. One syllable from him is more subtle than an entire Shakespeare speech when delivered by a lesser actor. Hackman is a national treasure.IMO, Dafoe is a well-meaning revelation until circumstances forces him to cave into Hackman\\'s just-get-it-done ways. He comes to see that idealism must relent to pragmatism in extreme cases, although that knowledge repulses him. He wants nothing more than to get out of the south and go home to a world he believes is cleaner and more simple.The conclusion of \\\\\"Mississippi\\\\\" is more bitter than sweet. The guilty are arrested and convicted, although their various punishments are a joke. (R. Lee Ermey is the only one in the bunch who meets a just fate.) McDormand is brutally beaten to within an inch of her life for betraying the status quo and doing the right thing.

       " \"I seldom watch Italian movies, (i saw it today for the first time) being Italian maybe i'm biased, but this one really stands out. A real masterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one, maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet it is so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen.\",\n",
       " \"I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo, the small Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and the older man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It is a deceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. You never want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreaking simplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable.\",\n",
       " 'Cinema Paradiso is a profoundly important movie because it deals with identifiable emotions/issues that could be considered universal on so many levels. The entire story is retrospective similar to Fellini\\'s style as well as a love story that pulls in the viewer on an emotional level. The film also attempts to expose an inkling of Sicilian life, language,(different from Italian) and how \\\\\"history\\\\\" has intruded upon and shaped the mentality of the Sicilian people; to also show that traditional concepts of what is \\\\\"moral\\\\\" or right is not to be taken for granted because of the people and their particular history. For those who do not fancy history or non-fiction, the film attempts to educate the \\\\\"outsider\\\\\" not familiar with Sicilian history as it pertains to the WWII era. I watch it again and again and see more and more details that pertain to the story. I did see it on the big screen at a local theater back in 1991 and it was a hit with the audience. I have several scenerio that I think could make it more interesting and am very curious about the uncut version and what is different about it. Finally, the movie does make me cry because it is after all a love story and it is clear at the end that Toto (aka Salvatore)is still in love with Elena and that is why he never married or settled down \\\\\"..to love one person. . . \\\\\" as his mother says to him after his 30 year absence from home. The final scene of the credits also shows him looking at Elena again and the look on his face is telling. This film has many little \\\\\"hints\\\\\" that serve to inform the viewer and give just a little more info. about the story. Truly, one of the best films I have ever seen !!! These characters come alive and we feel like we know them--personally. Viva Giuseppe Tornatore for his masterpiece!',\n",
       " \"Giuseppe Tornatore's Nuovo cinema Paradiso (Cinema Paradiso) is everything good about the movies. It is a story about love. The love between a Father and Son, an Individual and his home, and the love for the movies. Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are a filmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favorite film (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for the movie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of your questions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life. The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into a whole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect. If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals will push you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about. Terrific.\",\n",

       " 'Barry Levinson is one of the great screen directors of our time. He\\'s most notable for being able to evoke subtly comedic discussions amongst his leading characters, save the rare occasion when his strained efforts backfire (\\\\\"Toys\\\\\" comes to mind). \\\\\"Rain Man\\\\\" (1988) is his crowning effort, his best achievement I can think of off-hand. It\\'s considered a drama but it\\'s also a true odd couple comedy, about two opposites who learn they have one common bond: their kinship.The Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a wealthy car dealer living the high life in California. He\\'s just gotten in a shipment of Ferraris and he\\'s going to make a killing on an upcoming deal for all of them, when his entire background comes back to haunt him in a single unfortunate moment during his newly acquired and quite happy life.Charlie\\'s father has just died, leaving him an old sports car and rose bushes. But more painful than the fact that his father has died or that he was left simply with a car and some prize-winning rosebushes is the fact that Charlie had tried to put his ill-fated past behind him, and now it has caught up with him again. He has to face the reality of his father once again.This isn\\'t really evident the first time you watch the movie. Charlie is angered at the fact that he got nothing more than some bushes and a vehicle, sure, but he admits he expected nothing more. What really angers him is that he has to face his father, dead or alive, once more; either through faded memories or by the realization that he is now dead and their friendship was never repaired.When Charlie finds out that his father\\'s entire estate has been left to a single trustee, he schemes around and unmasks who the trustee really is -- his older brother he never knew he had, Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), who lives in a homey mental institute and quotes the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello \\\\\"Who\\'s on first?\\\\\" charade when he gets nervous.Charlie confronts his brother, who seems as though he doesn\\'t recognize him. And in a moment of weakness, Charlie kidnaps his brother from his home, drives him back to California, and attempts to squeeze the money out of Raymond, who has no holding on the concept of money at all.Despite his lack of understanding regarding monetary value, Raymond is an idiot savant, and Charlie takes advantage of Raymond\\'s mathematical skills by taking him to Las Vegas to count cards. After achieving a fortune they are thrown out of the casinos and left to face charges of kidnapping. The problem is, by the time it\\'s all over, Charlie has formed an odd sort of bond with his brother. Long after the laughs settle the emotional impact of the story sinks in.The ending is the sort of rare conclusion that brings tears to the eyes. Throughout the film, Charlie is an arrogant, ignorant, greedy businessman who cares of no one but himself. By the end, however, he has learned more than he has in his entire lifetime from the brother he never had. And unlike a lot of the buddy films out there, we get to see the bonding between Charlie and his big brother, Raymond, form on a daily basis, until it is brought to a standstill.Dustin Hoffman gives his best performance in \\\\\"Rain Man,\\\\\" one of such unmatched strength and brilliance that we often feel that we are really watching an autistic man on screen. Raymond Babbitt is one of the most memorable characters you will ever encounter as a viewer, and though Dustin Hoffman isn\\'t necessarily a favorite actor of mine, I place his performance in \\\\\"Rain Man\\\\\" as one of the most convincing and touching performances of all time.Trying to put the reason that \\\\\"Rain Man\\\\\" is so great into words is simply impossible. It\\'s got everything. And as humorous as Raymond Babbitt becomes, he never seems unreal or obnoxious. As I watch him every time I watch the movie, I completely forget Dustin Hoffman is playing him until I mentally remark on how well he is doing so. This is movie magic, folks.Hollywood has a fascination with characters like Forrest Gump and Raymond Babbitt, but -- even more so than Gump -- Raymond is never annoying. (That\\'s not saying that Gump is, but...Raymond is even more touching and realistic.) Raymond is a fair bit more impaired than Forrest, and we feel for him even more (though which is the better film I could never say).By all means, see this movie. Drop whatever you\\'re doing and rent it, buy it, watch it over and over. It\\'s amazing. I don\\'t care if I sound like a mainstream critic trying to get my quotes on the new Special Edition box of the DVD (yes, please!), I love this movie and I can\\'t say enough good things about it.',\n",

As for a best picture, I wasn't too sure. But the actors will impress you. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has wonderful characters and some great laughs.

Rex becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her and, when at last faced with the man who abducted Saskia, finally has the chance to find out. But there's one condition: Rex must surrender himself to Saskia's abductor and agree to experience the same thing she herself went through. The only trouble is, he has no idea what that might be, or even whether Saskia is alive or dead. Rex believes that the Not Knowing is the worst thing, but it isn't. The Knowing is the most horrible thing of all.This is a powerful film that practically punches you in the stomach with its gritty realism. The performances are flawless and haunting, and the climax and aftermath, delivered with a quiet matter-of-factness, are the very definition of horror. This is real horror, the kind we try not to think about but which can happen, and has. If this film doesn't disturb you, I can't think of anything that will. Highly recommended, but only for people who are emotionally equipped to deal with the fear and the terror that the camera never flinches from. People with claustrophobia would be wise to stay far away from this film.\",\n",
       " '\\\\\"The Vanishing\\\\\" is one of my favorite movies, probably in my top ten. I first saw it in 1990 in San Francisco. Without giving anything away, the end of this Dutch/French film contains an extraordinarily diabolical twist, and at the theater at which I saw it, the projector crapped out with about 15 minutes left. Everyone was issued a free pass to come back, which I did the next day, having barely been able to get the creepy story out of my head. I couldn\\'t wait to see what happened at the film\\'s conclusion. Fifteen years later, it still makes me shudder sometimes. The American remake with Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland should, in my opinion, be avoided at all cost; the ending was changed, no doubt to suit the bottom-line aspirations of some brain-dead producer. But the European original is full of great acting (particularly from the villain, Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a tight storyline, and, of course, a wickedly brilliant ending.

Yes, it's very long, but the characters are so memorable that the length didn't bother me at all - I loved the time spent in their company. In particular, Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin are each astonishing in their own way.  Olin is ferociously sensual and mesmerizing, while Binoche is superlatively sympathetic and sensitive.  Two of the best female performances I can remember.  By the end of the film I was totally wrapped up in these people's lives.  This film is deeply erotic but in an intelligent and adult way that puts most other film's treatment of sex to shame.  I thought it was beautifully handled by all concerned, and if I ever want to cry, I only need watch the scenes with the dog and the final scenes, both pulled off superbly.\",\n",
       " 'Romanticism originally doesn\\'t mean romance. The 19th century romantic hero was always a doomed one. The romantic characters long for something larger than life. The frailness, lightness of things is unbearable to those sensitive beings. This is why romantic stories typically end with the death of their heroes. Romanticism is the opposite of Hollywood, as there is no happy end. The epitome of a romantic story is for example \\\\\"Romeo and Juliet\\\\\", where death is preferred to an impossible love story.Because such intense feelings are a threat, some people try to escape them by taking nothing seriously. For example, Tomas (Daniel Day Lewis), a young surgeon living in Prague in the late sixties. He is a perfect womanizer, but he never sleeps together with any woman, because he instinctively refuses any attachment. Such is also sensuous Sabina (Lena Olin), his favorite mistress and best friend, whose utmost erotic weapon happens to be... a bowler hat.When Tomas is called for an operation at a small country spa, he seduces a young ingenuous waitress named Tereza (Juliette Binoche), but is not aware that she does not take things as lightly as he does. Bored to death with her provincial life, Tereza longs for something larger than life. She is vulnerable, sentimental, attaching. When she shows up by surprise at Tomas\\'s apartment in Prague one evening, he lets her stay. He is trapped.Neither of them suspects that they are living an intense moment in a crucial place. This is Prague, Czechoslovakia, the Eastern Block. But the winds of change are blowing in general enthusiasm, and Czechs believe that they are about to create \\\\\" socialism with a human face\\\\\". Encouraged by Sabina, Tereza becomes a photographer, and captures on film all the small daily life scenes, the beauty and uniqueness of every moment. Tereza\\'s caring love can\\'t stop Tomas having affairs with \\\\\"other women\\\\\", much to her disarray. As she finally can\\'t take it anymore, she decides to leave. But as she steps out on the dark streets, it sounds like an earthquake is coming. The Soviet tanks are entering the city. The reconstitution of Prague\\'s invasion in this movie is extraordinarily intense, even more so as clips of the real events are included in the footage. Those few moments alone are strong enough to make this long movie worth seeing. Tomas, Tereza and Sabina exile themselves to Geneva. Sabina has an affair with a married Swiss man, who \\\\\"doesn\\'t like bowler hats\\\\\". As he eventually decides to leave his wife for her, she is very shaken, but she disappears. No attachment. It\\'s lonely to be free. As for Tomas, Switzerland can\\'t stop him either playing Casanova. Tereza still can\\'t stand it, and she suddenly goes back to \\\\\"the land of the weak\\\\\". But I said it, Tomas is trapped. He can\\'t live without her. He can\\'t help following her back to Prague, although it\\'s clear there is no future for them there anymore. The story is an adaptation of a novel by much praised Czech novelist Milan Kundera, and it is one of those cases when the movie is more intense than the book. Whereas the movie is highly emotional, the book\\'s tone is dry, cold, almost clinical.Made by American director Philip Kaufman, this picture is European in every way. It captures perfectly well the \\\\\"old world\\\\\" nostalgic atmosphere of Czechoslovakia. The music score by Czech classical composers is gripping, sometimes melancholic, sometimes frantic. The lead actors are giving their all, and this film is certainly among their best performances for all three. The supporting cast also has some big European names in it (Erland Josephson, Daniel Olbrychski, Stellan Skarsg\\\\u00e5rd). Cheerful performance by Czech actor Pavel Landovsky, who personally lived the Prague events. Here, he appears as a jolly and solid peasant with a pet pig called Mephisto, who follows him just everywhere, even at wedding parties!Tomas and Tereza\\'s pet is a she-dog called Karenin. She is the symbol of their love. They adopt her at the beginning of their relationship, take her together to Geneva, but as she escapes, Tereza takes her along back to Prague. As Karenin gets ill in the end, they make her a lethal injection so that she doesn\\'t suffer. Pretty much what will happen to them too.And well, I never knew bowler hats could be so erotic!',\n",

I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie.

       " \"Let's say that you're an avid film-goer and you want to test your level of tolerance in terms of the type of bad taste, vile and disgusting screen images you can bear. Certain people would direct you to the zombie/cannibal movies made in Italy in the 1970s and if you took their advice you would indeed find yourself faced with some pretty unpleasant viewing material. However, such films are also very poorly made, with an emphasis on exploitation and somewhat shaky and grainy camera work. For an equally vile and disturbing film, made with considerably more skill and elegance (not to mention aspects of a Jacobean revenge play to please the intelligensia) look no further than The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. This movie is just as outrageous, nauseating and horrific as any Italian cannibal flick, but in a breathtakingly artistic way. Michael Gambon gives a menacing portrayal as a vulgar gangster with a penchant for rich food. He is a regular customer at an elegant restaurant where he and his cronies, and his unhappy wife, wine and dine while exchanging tales of crime and debauchery. One evening his wife claps eyes on a rather geeky librarian at a nearby table; she fancies him immediately and before you know it the pair are embarking on a torrid sexual affair. Gambon discovers that his wife is having this affair so he has the librarian killed but his wife teams up with a cook from the restaurant to come up with a terrifying revenge plot. It's impossible to reveal the details of the revenge plot without spoiling the film, but suffice to say that it is unforgettable, revolting and ingenious. Greenaway directs the film in his customary unique visual style, but the narrative is more viewer-friendly than usual in his films, making this one of his more watchable and entertaining offerings. The actors give great performances (brave performances, too, considering the explicit full frontal nudity they are asked to do). The music richly complements the scenes on screen. This film is remarkable on many levels but it's definitely adults-only stuff and even then it's not for all tastes. However, if you want something a little different and you're not afraid to be seriously disturbed, this will do nicely.\",\n",
       " '\\\\\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\\\\" (1989) was the masterful culmination of Woody Allen\\'s dramatic period in the 80\\'s, in which he made brilliant movies like \\\\\"Hannah and Her Sisters\\\\\", \\\\\"Another Woman\\\\\" or \\\\\"September\\\\\". In these movies he tried his best to play with Ingmar Bergman\\'s narrative and aesthetic preoccupations, which are incidentally also Allen\\'s. He has also always been successful at incorporating wit and comedy into the dramatic arc. In \\\\\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\\\\" he confronts two philosophies of life with each other. And once the two story lines are set into motion, almost every scene plays off the theme of the movie. We meet Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau), a successful and beloved doctor. Coming home with his family from a gala, he finds a letter from his mistress Dolores (Angelica Huston); addressed to his wife. Judah meets Dolores in her apartment, where she explains her deep dissatisfaction with the current situation. She wants Judah on her own, whereas he feels that this affair is getting out of hand and wants to end it. Consecutively Dolores begins to threaten him with uncovering a fund theft he was involved in and with admitting their affair to his wife. Judah cannot see out of this predicament and calls up his Mafioso brother (Jerry Orbach) to help him getting rid of her. Cliff Stern (Woody Allen) on the other hand is a struggling documentary filmmaker, married to a woman who stopped having sex with him a year ago and who would rather see him work than not. So Cliff goes against his principles and takes the job kindly given to him by his wife\\'s brother Lester (Alan Alda), a millionaire TV producer. Cliff has to follow Lester around New York to document his visions for a TV program. On the job he meets Halley Reed (Mia Farrow), an associate producer, who gets interested in his work of passion, a documentary about a Jewish philosopher. At the same time Cliff begins to take interest in Halley.Cliff is portrayed by Allen as a humble, wise and cynical man, who never managed to connect his aspirations to the demands of the real world. He has nothing to offer except his love and knowledge. This enables him to be a mentor to his young niece, but does not profit him in his relationship with Halley. The little girl also works as a stand-in for Cliff\\'s conversations with his conscience. This device is made clearer in Rosenthal\\'s segments, where he confides himself to a rabbi.So we have a dual storyline, where one section is morally repugnant and the other one is idealistic. The rabbi tells Rosenthal that their conversations are always about two views of life. One believes in a harsh world, empty of values and with a pitiless moral structure, while the other sees meaning and forgiveness and a higher power. Rosenthal has heard similar things before, since he was raised very religiously. \\\\\"The eyes of God are on us always\\\\\", advised his father. And when it came to the question of God\\'s existence he would add: \\\\\"In case of doubt I will always choose God over truth.\\\\\" But Judah cannot let God interfere when he plans to kill his lover. He feels guilt, alright, but people get used to circumstances. We deny and try to forget.When in Cliff\\'s segment the Jewish professor commits suicide, it comes as a shock. Suddenly a philosophical system has been taken away. Isn\\'t that one of the things we fear the most? To realize that our beliefs are incomplete and wrong. This understanding only tightens as the movie progresses. The rabbi is going blind, morality has lost. In the end the film is a sobering account of how immorality, deceit and its more harmless companions prevail.I feel Allen had to let the downbeat ending happen, to express a fear of his. In the 90\\'s he would often return to lighter themes. This expresses his curiosity in all aspects of existence. Light and darkness coexist. Tonally \\\\\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\\\\" is not a dark movie. Allen repeatedly breaks up an emotional scene with a punch-line. But Allen is always consistent in his tone, whatever subjects or periods he chooses. He is a tough worker, who has made 33 movies since 1969, which amounts to roughly one movie a year. \\\\\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\\\\" is the clearest in its vision and among his very best.',\n",

However, I am somewhat disappointed to see how people tend to misinterprate this film by proclaiming that the movie's message of carpe deium is derailed by the fact that those who apply it end up losing.  This could not be further from the truth.  In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous.  The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove.  Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority.  Some may not like it but his story serves to prove just how important it is to stand one's ground no matter how hard it may be.  It's not only his character, but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth.  I urge everyone to give this movie a chance and to see it for what it really is.  It may just change your life.\",\n",

The basic message is to \\\\\"suck the marrow out of life\\\\\", as the passage for the society reads, or to live every moment to the fullest.

I would never ever have thought I'd enjoy seeing the world through Yugoslavian gypsies' eyes, but it turned out to be possible so long as it's Kusturica who opens the window. Goran Bregovic's adorable tunes suit the movie perfectly fine too.

       " 'This is the first time I\\'ve commented upon a film at IMDB, but after watching Field Of Dreams for the, ohh, dozenth or so time, I just wanted to share my ramblings and musings on this film. I first saw this film almost a decade or so ago, I was watching it alone on video after idly looking through some tapes for something. I was caught by the amount of glowing recommendations on the cover, and although it seemed to involve lots of baseball, something that I have never been even remotely drawn to, I thought I\\'d give it a chance. An hour and 40 minutes later and I had dissolved into a steam of tears, that were only broken up by the smile stretched right across my face. To me, this is the closest film I\\'ve seen that I would consider being perfect. My favourite film is The Godfather, with Godfather Part Two right alongside, but no film gives me such an emotionally rewarding experience as Field Of Dreams. This truly is a film dipped in magic waters. Why do I love this film so? The acting right across the board is naturalistic and strong. We believe the characters when they say what they say and do what they do. The whole tone and design of the film let us believe in the choices the characters make, we want Ray to build the field and have Shoeless Joe appear, we want Terrance Mann to go Finway Park with Ray, we want Archie Graham to get to play his dream, and most of all, even though we don\\'t expect it or see it coming (well I didn\\'t), we want Ray to get to throw a catch with his dad.&gt; The design, again, is wonderful. The lighting, and cinematography make your eyes and your heart ache, the magic hour lighting, the little break in Ray\\'s voice when he asks his dad if he wants to have a catch, the moment Doc steps over the field and into the present to save Karin, when Mark mouths \\\\\"What the f...\\\\\" upon first seeing Doc Graham, the score, the fact that they talk about smoking grass and trying acid in what is essentially a family film in content and marketing, when Archie Graham gets picked up on the way back home and says \\\\\"Hi, I\\'m Archie Graham\\\\\", the sheer  MAGIC!!! Anyone thinking they may even be slightly put off by thinking the film is a baseball film, don\\'t be. It\\'s not about baseball, the sport serves as the backdrop for a story about loss, reconciliation, parents and family, dreams and having the courage to go through them. It really is a universal and timeless film, which is a cliched saying, but this is really one of those cases where it more than justifies the comment. Simply beautiful.',\n",

Of course, it's not long before evil spirits pop up again in Manhattan and they're back doing what they do best.

Bill Murray gets the great one liners again, and his scenes with Sigourney Weaver are just as goods as the first film.

Wagner. History is brought to life more vividly in this film than in any big-budget all-star cast epic I can recall. Most often , those films only succeed in collapsing under their own weight and leaving audiences more turned off about history.

The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown.  Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human.  This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with CP.  By no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings.

I\\'ve read reviews wherein people feel that the character of Peter Loew has descended into madness as a result of being a jilted lover. But his madness is more about his crushing loneliness in a world where everyone around him seems to be happily and easily paired off. In spite of his solitude, he is emotionally unable to connect to anyone. One night, he brings a woman back to his place, but while in the throes of passion, a bat flies into his apartment through an open window. The mystery and excitement of fighting off the bat becomes more erotic and interesting to him than the willing beauty in arms. Terrified of the closeness he craves, he sabotages any opportunities he has for actual relationships in favor of elusive fantasies and hallucinations. His fear of commitment manifests itself as a vampire lover in the form of Rachel (Jennifer Beales), a woman he has had one conversation with in a bar, but has never made it with, except in his own fantasy world. There, she is a dominatrix of a vampire, sucking the life out of him, making him a prisoner of her demands, hungers, and lusts, distracting and preventing him from any real intimacy, promising him that soon, he will \\\\\"be with her.\\\\\"The vampire is the only one to whom he can say \\\\\"I love you,\\\\\" and she doesn\\'t even exist--not really. She represents the promise of something more exciting right around the next corner. Peter simply cannot commit to anything else when love and immortality are so close, but so far...Vampires seem human, but they aren\\'t human; they FEED ON humans. They\\'re dead, cold, and isolated from the warmth of human existence--which is exactly how Peter feels, and why he believes he\\'s becoming one. Plus, he is suicidal, and he seems to have found a way to receive deliverance in the form of his secretary Alva, who he begins to torment in earnest once he discovers she carries a gun, hoping she\\'ll (justifiably) use it on him.It\\'s over the top and a little hard to understand, but I found this movie so engaging, and Cage\\'s performance so funny and astonishing, in spite of the dark subject matter, that I have watched it over and over again. I have used this movie as a compatibility test for potential mates (which is sort of Peter-ish, I guess), and if they like it, I know it\\'s a good match. If it had been performed another way, by another actor, I don\\'t know if I would like it at all. But Cage brings brutality, vulnerability, tragedy, and all-out desperation together to create a complex character the like of which I have never seen before or since. Sure, there are violent scenes; but are they real, or are they his imagination? We\\'ll never know. So much of \\\\\"Vampire\\'s Kiss\\\\\" happens in Loew\\'s mind that all we know for sure is that he\\'s desperately alone. So alone, he\\'s willing to drive someone else over the edge to help ease his pain. He\\'s so cowardly and childish that he uses terror as a way to achieve relief from his horrible solitude--death is less frightening to him than actually getting close to a real person. Therein lies the horror, and the sadness, of \\\\\"Vampire\\'s Kiss.\\\\\" And in Cage, lies the performance which makes this story watchable, and actually very funny.',\n",

       " 'It\\'s hard for me to believe that fourteen years have passed since I first saw this movie. I was only ten at the time, and this was the first movie I ever saw that was both an eye-filling and a mind-filling spectacle. It was also one of only two theater-going experiences that I ever had with my late grandmother, and I always think of her when I watch this movie. It always takes me back to an earlier time in my life no matter how many times I see it.This is one movie that could only have been made in the post-Vietnam era, when Americans began to question the moral integrity of their country. How else to explain, in the opening sequence depicting the Civil War, the utter cynicism of the soldier who speaks with Costner\\'s Dunbar character? Or Dunbar\\'s later observation that \\\\\"there was no dark political objective\\\\\" to the Sioux battling the Pawnee? The scene in which Dunbar receives his orders from the mentally ill major also seems to speak of Vietnam, the point being I think that while an entire generation of young men was being cut down in the Civil War the West was being managed by those who were not fit for duty in the larger conflict. Maury Chaykin, in that one scene, gives one of the most memorable and haunting performances I\\'ve seen in any film.This movie\\'s depiction of Native Americans is not nearly as politically correct as it may seem to those who watch it only once or only at a superficial level. In the very first scene depicting Indians, in fact, a Pawnee brave shoots one of the white characters full of arrows and then scalps him. The unrepentant villainy of Wes Studi\\'s character, in particular, recalls the moral simplicity of countless earlier Westerns.Even the most sympathetic Indian character in the movie, Kicking Bird, is not kind to Dunbar merely to be friendly but because he believes he can get useful information out of the white soldier about the other whites who are encroaching on Sioux territory. The interaction between Dunbar and the Sioux is powerfully effective precisely because the Sioux remain true to themselves. They are not cartoonishly hostile like the Indians depicted in old Westerns, but they are not soft or na\\\\u00efve either. While this movie draws its inspiration from American epics as diverse as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and The Searchers (1956), its originality lies not only in its respect for Native Americans but also in its intensely personal treatment of the main character. Few other three-hour epics (Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart come to mind ) have developed their protagonists as fully and dynamically as this movie develops Costner\\'s Dunbar character.Even after fourteen years, the Dunbar character\\'s arc, going from a suicidal soldier in the opening sequence to an adopted Sioux who in the final scenes puts the needs of his people ahead of his own, is still one of the most remarkable I\\'ve seen in any movie. Costner\\'s performance won no awards that I know of, but it provides the movie\\'s indispensably tight focus. He\\'s completely convincing every step of the way, if a bit too clumsy and self-effacing at times, hitting his head in the dark and fainting after a confrontation in a heavy-handed attempt to demystify the West.Another quality this movie shares with The Searchers is that it associates the physical challenges of the frontier with the testing of the soul. The Dunbar character cleans out the watering hole at the fort because he refuses to lose his humanity like the men before him who abandoned the fort. Later he cannot decide whether he feel more or less at home in the presence of the Sioux, because he is struggling to remain true to himself even as he remains unsure of who he is.This movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It\\'s a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won\\'t see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you\\'ll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you\\'ll forget they\\'re acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I\\'d give it a perfect 10, because it\\'s one of the best I\\'ve ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie\\'s extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it\\'s difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese\\'s Goodfellas. There\\'s no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It\\'s a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they manage to be both joyful and sad. This is a movie that looks into the very fabric of this country\\'s past, and asks us to do the same.Rating: 10 (Good job, everybody.)',\n",

The acting is great, Tom Hanks does an admirable job, however,it isn't acting which makes the movie great. The superb directing, creating realistic and horrible scenes of dirty political games and black (literally) PR, capture my attention. So, to sum up, a brilliant political satire.

That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10\",\n",
       " 'I was attached to the USS Portsmouth when this movie was made here in San Diego, at the Point Loma Submarine Base; some of my closest friends were cast as Soviet sailors in the movie. This movie is amazingly accurate on many levels (granted, there are goofs here and there...but nothing that a non-submarine sailor would be likely to catch). I actually had the pleasure of serving onboard two of the subs featured in this movie; the second one was the USS Blueback (SS 581), which was the last diesel submarine in our navy. The scene where the submarine flies out of the water is actually the Blueback, during an emergency surface; a little scary the first time I did it, but incredibly fun every other time I did it. This movie brings back so many memories, and I hope that everyone enjoyed it as much as I have.',\n",
       " 'Tim Burton should have won an academy award for this film. It is truelly a masterpiece. Never have I felt more sympathetic for a character before in my life. Edward Scissorhands...a creation...an unfinished product made by an inventor, his father. When his \\\\\"father\\\\\" dies he is left alone in the mansion to fend for himself and discover things on his own without any guidance. Next an avon lady comes in and detaches him from his isolation and throws him into a society where everything is pastel, everything is precise and everyone is stiff. Edward Scissorhands gets thrown into a world comPLETELY unlike the one he was used to. Now he is the outsider.Johnny Depp should have also won an Academy Award for his performance in this film. Although he had very few lines in this film, less than 100, his facial expressions and actions spoke loudly. Every detail he gave his character was so perfect and precise. When Edward examines the water bed, and takes his first sip of (what I\\'m guessing is) scotch, or in the beginning when he takes his first ride ever in a car into town. Just the look on his face when he finally gets to see what the outside world looks like was pure genius.I hold this movie very deeply to my heart. In my opinion it encompasses every human emotion and nature. When Edward first arrives the locals accepted him and he became a famed hair/bush stylist. In the end they turn on him and see him for what he looks like, a monster. My rating for this film: 10/10',\n",
       " \"Edward Scissorhands is really an amazing movie.  The plethora of lush cinematography, beautiful musical score, and great characters are extremely entertaining.  The storyline is simple yet very moving.  I still get misty-eyed at the end, even though I watched it many times already.  The musical scores by the amazing Danny Elfman in Edward Scissorhands are one of his best work.  It is achingly beautiful.  Everytime Tim Burton and Danny Elfman worked together in a movie, magic happens.  Burton's gothic style and Elfman's halloween-like scores always blends perfectly.The story surrounds an unfinished creation named Edward, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp.  The talented actor managed to make Edward a simple being that radiates vulnerability as well as restrained passion suggesting the real, imperfect humanity within.  Edward's intimidating scissorhands and strange black &amp; white physical appearance looked out of place amongst the pastel-colored suburban surroundings.  He is unique; we both laugh and sympathize when we see Edward having a hard time trying to eat a single green pea with his scissorhands, but then we become slack-jawed to see that his expression of artistry in sculpting are effortless, masterful, imaginative, and passionate.The movie ends rather sadly, yet beautifully at the same time.  The tragic incident at the end over Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) is a single act of both unvented frustrations over the injustices done by Jim, as well as to protect Kim Boggs (Winona Ryder), the love of his life.  This shows that although uncompleted, the fearsome scissorhands merely masks our eyes to his feelings, conflicts, and the imperfections of that of a real human being. His body is not completed, but his heart is.\",\n",
       " \"There is absolutely no way I can view this film in even a remotely objective manner, so I won't even try.  Like eveything I've seen by Tim Burton, this film is at one and the same time, warm and frightening, tender and heart-wrenchingly evil, uplifting and dark.  The good and bad in humanity are shown in stark relief quite clearly for everyone to see.  But in the final analysis, the most important message the film has to offer is this: Love truly does make the world go 'round and redemption and just living to see another day is a kind of victory.  There will always be bullies, just as there will always be kind souls who actively try to make things better (and who sometimes make things worse through their efforts).  The most important thing is to be true to yourself, treat others as you wish to be treated and that if the bad guys win, we all lose-including the bad guys.  Excellent cast, fine script and just overall a worthy effort not to be missed.  One of Vincent Price's last performances, if not the last.  I love this film!  Most highly recommended.\",\n",
       " 'You could have thought that Tim Burton would rest on his laurels, following \\\\\"Batman\\\\\"\\'s huge commercial success. Well, not at all. \\\\\"Edward Scissorhands\\\\\" appears like a more serious, more mature and even touching movie. This modern fairy tale links skilfully elements from the basic fairy tale (the castle) and elements from the social life (Peg\\'s job as representative for a cosmetics firm) and it can be divided into two parts: the first one that epitomizes Edward\\'s rise: thanks to his scissorhands that give him gifts as a hairdresser and a gardener, he becomes the idol of the town. The second one that shows Edward\\'s fall, following a burglary in which he was inconveniently involved in, he becomes the town\\'s b\\\\u00eate noire (and the movie becomes painful) Tim Burton tells this modern fairy tale by introducing a lot of poetry, and during his movie, he tries to create an aesthetic beauty and he succeeds in, especially with the gardens of the castle, Edward\\'s sculptures and Edward himself is good-looking in spite of his scissorhands. But \\\\\"Edward Scissorhands\\\\\" is also a movie of contrasts. There\\'s an obvious contrast between the brightly coloured town and the dark rooms of the castle but also one between the bright town and its inhabitants who are scornful or mocking. Besides, they\\'re the object of a satire of the actual society and Burton tries to underline its weaknesses. Of course, the inhabitants appreciate Edward but only for his gifts. Otherwise, they\\'re mistrustful towards him because, in their eyes, he\\'s different and eccentric (you could be one of the inhabitants!) and the single mistake (the burglary) can lead to unexpected consequences... Whereas Johnny Depp, he\\'s simply extraordinary and finds here, one of his best roles. He provides to his character, a lot of tenderness, affection and above all, a deep sensitivity. At last, Tim Burton knew skilfully how to blend several cinematographic styles in just one film. In \\\\\"Edward Scissorhands\\\\\", you find everything: comedy, fantastic, horror and drama. Moreover, Danny Elfman\\'s gothic music is widely gorgeous to create an intense emotion. It\\'s sometimes difficult to hold his tears... All in all, a movie which is both tender, cruel and Tim Burton\\'s best movie after \\\\\"Ed Wood\\\\\".',\n",
       " \"First of all, it's not hard to figure out that Edward Scissorhands is a movie where the main character is a man with scissors for hands. The next obvious question is why or how would someone have scissors for hands? Even if I suspend disbelief and accept that somehow this could be possible or just ignore that it is never explained and accept that a boy with scissor hands came to exist, then I have to wonder how his existence supports the telling of an interesting story with an important message. The message in the story to not prejudge others based on appearance or differences, but rather based on the things we share in our quest for happiness, and based on how our actions reveal our intentions. My conclusion is that the creation of this character is not only unnecessary to making the point, but dilutes it terribly due to absurdity and poor story telling. If you feel you really must see it to satisfy your curiosity, then be warned and prepare to be disappointed.\",\n",

Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.\",\n",
       " \"The Godfather Part three is a great movie but many would contest. This final installment of the greatest trilogy ever made is misunderstood by most because they do not see what this film is really about. G3 is  not about hits and gangland killings, but rather, G3 is about the end of Michael Corleone's legacy of crime in America. This movie shows him stepping out of the gambling and the other rackets because they have hurt him so badly. This movie is a masterpiece because it shows the conclusion to an incredible story. There had to be an end to this trilogy and this thoughtful way to do it exemplified the trilogy as an unbeatable one. Just because it doesn't end with a violent scene like the murder of the heads of the 5 families does not make it a bad movie, but in this case, a beautiful one. Please, don't feel you have to agree with the common view by proxy, but think on your own about what this movie really means and how it concludes and consequences the first two.\",\n",
       " \"I finally saw it ! As a total devotee of the two previous installments, I avoided seeing the third one, on purpose, people I respect had told me about the disappointment and, quite honestly, I didn't go there. Last night I did and surprise, surprise, it moved me no end. Maybe because I haven't seen the other two in four years. Yes at times is more Ken Russell than Francis Ford Coppola and in my book that's not a bad thing. I was, however, a bit taken aback by the healing in Pacino's Michael as far as Keaton's Kay is concerned. As it nothing had ever happened, while in Diane Keaton the memory of that pain is always present. Talia Shire is a lot of fun as a sort of Madame Sin. Raf Vallone, superb as the doomed Pope John Paul I and then a bit puzzling casting choices that I think they me code for something. George Hamilton, for instance, takes over from where Rubert Duvall left off. Helmut Berger plays the head of the Vatican Bank. Helmut Berger! Just as curious as to find Troy Donahue in The Godfather Part II - All in all, I'm really glad I've seen it and I'm sure I'll see it again.\",\n",
       " \"The audience for this film stayed away because of Don Johnson. In his defense, Johnson has been in a few very good films (Melanie, A Boy &amp; His Dog), and he is very smooth and sleazy here. Fueled by a great sound-track, provided by John Lee Hooker, Miles Davis and Jack Nitzsche, this dirty edged noir evokes a Jim Thompson like feel, and is beautifully lit and shot. Dennis Hopper directed, and he did just fine. There is so little good noir in the last 30 plus years, that fans of the genre will want to see this. And if you get the chance to see it on the big screen, it is well worth it. In an era when no 'new noir' comes close to Polanski's Chinatown, this movie is way better than Body Heat or LA Confidential. It certainly looks better, and has a much rawer sensibility and texture.\",\n",
       " 'The film begins with Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) and his platoon in Vietnam. When they\\'re suddenly attacked, it\\'s chaos, and the platoon appear to be the victims of some kind of chemical warfare. Jacob is stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet. Suddenly, without explanation, we see Jacob back in New York City. He\\'s returned home from the war and he\\'s trying to get his life back on track, but he keeps having odd experiences, seeing odd, frightening people, and having close calls with death. He cannot tell \\\\\"dreams\\\\\" from reality. What happened to him in Vietnam? Jacob\\'s Ladder is the grandfather of the \\\\\"rubber reality\\\\\" films that became so popular throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. The films with the most direct influence from Jacob\\'s Ladder have appeared more recently-- Memento (2000), Mulholland Dr. (2001), The I Inside (2003), and The Butterfly Effect (2004). Less obvious, but also strongly influenced are films such as Abre los ojos (1997)/Vanilla Sky (2001), eXistenZ (1999), The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and The Matrix (1999), as well as films where the \\\\\"rubber reality\\\\\" is usually played more straight, such as The Sixth Sense (1999) and The Others (2001).Of course, like any artwork, Jacob\\'s Ladder has its precursors, too, such as the short story by Ambrose Bierce called \\\\\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\\\\", which was originally published in 1891 and later used as a basis of a silent film called The Spy (1929), and then a French short entitled La Riviere du hibou (literally \\\\\"The River of the Owl\\\\\"), the latter also airing as an episode of \\\\\"The Twilight Zone\\\\\" (1959). There is a very strong religious/mythical allegory running throughout the film--seen in everything from the Judeo/Christian nature of the character\\'s names and the title of the film itself to character interests, as Jacob begins extensively studying demonology, the occult and so forth in an attempt to figure out what is happening to him. We are also treated to subtle connections with other works, such as philosopher Albert Camus\\' novel L\\'Etranger (\\\\\"The Stranger\\\\\"), which Jacob is reading in the film when we first see him on the subway, and there are many at least subtle stylistic and content precursors, such as Altered States (1980).In light of the subsequent instantiations of the film\\'s brand of rubberizing reality, as well as the more purely stylistic elements that have been used to often excellent effect in later films, such as the hyper kinetic figural motion that found its way into William Malone\\'s films House on Haunted Hill (1999) and Fear dot Com (2002), Jacob\\'s Ladder may seem relatively transparent or even tame. It\\'s certainly easier to reach an interpretation for this than for a film like Mulholland Dr., where director David Lynch is purposefully obfuscatory. Still, Jacob\\'s Ladder is one of the better films of its kind. Director Adrian Lyne achieved a continually offsetting creepiness that is rarely matched, and some scenes--such as the gurney journey through the increasingly dilapidated hospital corridors, could not possibly be topped.Seen in the context of Lyne\\'s other films Jacob\\'s Ladder is all the more surprising, as the bulk of his career has been focused on hyper sensual and sexy dramas and thrillers--such as 9 1/2 Weeks (1986), Fatal Attraction (1987), Indecent Proposal (1993), Lolita (1997) and Unfaithful (2002). Jacob\\'s Ladder has its share of eroticism, however, mostly through the gorgeous and impassioned Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena), even though her most heated moment has her appropriately fraternizing with a demon.Lyne\\'s relatively straightforward approach to the film\\'s elastic ontology, especially in conjunction with his tendency to be forthcoming and thorough in explaining his view of the plot (a predilection shared by scriptwriter Bruce Joel Rubin) may be unfortunate in that there is an interpretation of Jacob\\'s Ladder accepted by a vast majority as the \\\\\"right answer\\\\\". That\\'s a shame because there are countless possible readings of this material; differing views on everything from the general crux to the smallest minutiae. Part of the inherent beauty of the film is that any scene or set of scenes may equally be taken as the \\\\\"real events\\\\\", and any of the dialogue may be taken as providing clues to your preferred interpretation.Robbins\\' performance is important to the film in that he is the focal point of almost every scene and has to convincingly play a vast range of emotions; he does so with finesse. The rest of the cast is noteworthy, even though their questionable nature gives them a lot of leeway in terms of verisimilitude and consistency.But the real driving force that makes Jacob\\'s Ladder such a success is its eeriness. This is a horror film after all, both on psychological and more apparent supernatural levels. Lyne continually and disconcertingly pulls the rug from beneath not only Jacob, but the audience as well, yet manages to never make a viewer feel lost, instead producing an eagerness to solve the \\\\\"mystery\\\\\" while you root for Jacob.',\n",
       " \"This is easily one of Adrian Lyne's best films.  Tim Robbins is excellent and the visual affects were just awesome.  I saw this movie for the first time in the theatre and it blew me away.  I've seen it many times after that, purely for the visuals that were done so well.  The plot twists and turns as it spirals downward slowly revealing the truth and keeps you guessing all the way to the surprising ending.  This is a dark, violent, beautiful movie that I recommend to all people who love horror, and just a smart story that will keep you in suspense until the very end.\",\n",
       " \"Jacob's Ladder is a masterpiece. Nothing less.It has a highly intelligent plot though not difficult or artsy and is void of cliches. It therefore confuses and aggravates many viewers and professional reviewers always wanting a standard has-it-all Hollywood outpouring.It is so few films that leaves room for independent thoughts. Jacob's Ladder tumbles your mind the same way a dream of your own does. I have never felt this effect in a film so strong before. The images comes pouring in and your brain tries to make sense of it. Whenever you think you have a grasp it slides away again.The brilliance of the progression of the story, twists and turns, and the final explanation, so obvious but elusive as real dreams are, makes it on par with the best of Kubrick.\",\n",

When he finishes his last Misery book, he decides to celebrate and is heading back for his daughter\\'s birthday, but he gets caught in a horrible blizzard and gets into a nasty and fatal car accident, but is saved by Kathy Bates, or as we know her Annie.He wakes up in a bedroom with his legs badly broken, bruised up, and cut up, but hears a light and charming voice saying \\\\\"You\\'re going to be just fine. I\\'m your number one fan!\\\\\". Annie nurses Paul back to health and says she\\'ll get an ambulance once the storm clears up. She\\'s so lovely and charming, you would never have any clue that she\\'d even just harm a fly. But when she gets ahold of Paul\\'s last Misery book, she gets infuriated when she finds out that he\\'s killing off Misery and continuing onto more dramatic and dark stories. She makes him write a new Misery where she is resurrected, Paul used to write for a living, now he\\'s writing to stay alive. Discovering slowly how crazy Annie is, he tries to escape more and more, but Annie is so convinced she\\'s in love with him, she\\'ll never let him go! Kathy Bates truly is the amazing star of the film, she is so disturbing to watch. Especially during the \\\\\"hobbing\\\\\" scene, she breaks Paul\\'s legs again, she makes it seem so innocent, but it\\'s HORRIFYING to watch! Both her and James worked so well together and were just incredible. The movie is so awesome, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone! It\\'s a movie not to be missed.10/10',\n",
       " \"Pacific Heights is required viewing in all Apartment Management courses in San Diego County. It is a chilling tale of decent but uneducated and unprepared new owners with a dream unknowingly up against a seasoned player in the professional renter game. This viewing requirement is one of the tools used to introduce starry-eyed management newcomers to the harsh and not-so-easily apparent world of the sick, the dangerous and the sue-happy portion of the rental market who will try to get the management stripped of all their personal assets and possessions, fired and possibly jailed, who work diligently to get the owner's property away from him/her, and who have no objection to going down as long as they can take others with them. Great movie.\",\n",
       " 'WTF is wrong with people? Predator-1 had more Arnie than Predator. This movie simply has more Predator. It also greatly expanded the Predator universe and franchise. It introduced a whole new bunch of Pred weapons, tactics and behavior which never ever seemed out of place and were perfect fits. It explored their race further. All these were added to full effect in the AvP and AvP-2 PC games which were smash hits so imagine how horrible it would be if this movie never happened? The urban (steel jungle?) setting contrasts against the previous jungle setting and is a major plus for this movie. This movie was also extremely realistic and gory. All in all, this movie is fantastic and a few ignorant critics just want to bring it down by comparing it with the uniqueness of the original.',\n",
       " 'As a psychologist who has worked with child abuse victims and their families for over 30 years, and as a survivor of horrific child abuse myself, I would say that The Reflecting Skin is the most psychologically accurate depiction of child abuse that I\\'ve ever seen. And certainly the most uncompromising in terms of not romanticizing the victim. In The Reflecting Skin--SPOILER ALERT--the central victim is an 8-year-old farm boy, who is traumatized at one time or another by nearly everyone in his life. His mother, Ruth, rejects him and punishes him with water poisoning. His father, Luke, commits suicide in front of him. A depressed young widow, Dolphin Blue, terrorizes him with details of her husband\\'s suicide and remnants of his corpse she has saved in a cigar box. Even his beloved older brother, Cameron, who himself is a victim of both his mother\\'s incestuous advances and the US military\\'s atomic testing program in the Pacific, is sometimes physically and emotionally abusive towards him\\\\u2014at one point showing him the photo of a Hiroshima baby with \\\\\"reflecting skin,\\\\\" from which the film takes its names. But unlike the usual tearjerker Hollywood movie about child abuse, Seth is no more an \\\\\"innocent angel\\\\\" than is his brother or his father or his friends who get murdered. At the point we meet Seth running through a Van Gogh-colored field with a huge toad in his hands, he is already turning into the next generation of abuser\\\\u2014happily blowing up that toad with air the same way his mother blows him up with water. And he manages to retaliate against one of the adult abusers in his environment, Dolphin Blue, in the process. But he doesn\\'t mean to kill her. Yet that is where his silence about the gang of serial killers he sees roaming the country roads in a black Caddy finally leads. That is the realization that finally shatters him. But what alternative to silence does he have? The best chance he has of stopping the killers is when Sheriff Ticker tries to force him into spilling his secrets. Yet the sheriff is so verbally abusive to Seth\\\\u2014even to the point of threatening to split Seth\\'s head open to get the truth out of him\\\\u2014that Seth freezes and says nothing. Like most abused kids Seth believes that he\\'s entirely on his own. And to judge from all the negative reviews of this film he has reason to feel that no one will understand him and know how to help him. Because of all the abuse he\\'s already internalized at the point the film begins, he is no more lovable as a victim than the mummified fetus he tries to make his friend.',\n",
       " 'RoboCop 2 is probably the most under-rated and most harshly criticized sequel in history (tying with Predator 2, which came out the same year). Because of a few missing elements from the first and a slightly more cartoonish approach to the violence, the critics and public alike were not pleased and opinions and feelings toward the franchise nosedived with the just plain awful RoboCop 3.Don\\'t con yourself out of a good movie though. RoboCop 2 still has the same savage sense of humor, cynical social commentary and character pathos of the first film. It\\'s a hyper-realistic vision of an America populated by gun-loving psychos, a democracy owned by big business and the poverty-stricken addicted to drugs dealt to them by peddlers believing themselves to be the second coming of Christ.Far-fetched could be the typical way of describing it. Completely-over-the-top would be more appropriate. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner chucks in as much sadistic violence, deafening gunfire, endless destruction and loss of human life that the film just begs you not to take it so seriously.Some of the blame was placed on writer Frank Miller for the film being more cartoonish than the original. I don\\'t think this is very fair. I read Miller\\'s original script when I was in high school and it is rather different and, dare I say, unfilmable. RoboCop 2 himself was not Nuke Lord Caine, the psychotic hippie with delusions of Godhood. He was called Kong, a psychotic cop who pretty much killed everybody he came across. Sgt. Reed and the Old Man died too, and there wasn\\'t much humor. Screenwriter Walon Green was hired to doctor the script and much of what appears on screen is actually his work. Frank Miller\\'s original ideas are pretty much just left as the framework for the whole movie and some of his story was recycled into RoboCop 3 (don\\'t blame him for that one either). Miller was obviously upset with this but was still a good enough sport to appear in the film (keep a lookout for him playing Doctor Frank), though he vowed not to work in Hollywood again for fear of being taken advantage of. Until Robert Rodriguez promised to make good on his Sin City graphic novels.Verhoven may be gone but Irvin Kershner tries hard to deliver the same mix of mirth and magic and actually does get it right. Basil Poledouris\\' brooding score is also gone (it returns in RoboCop 3) but new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and upbeat theme that suits the film more than Poledouris\\' moody, tormented score to the first.There have also been many complaints that the humanity of RoboCop and his relationship with Lewis was neutered along with too many other ideas fighting for screen time. I get why most would be annoyed by this but you have to remember that films need to be economic when it comes to length. If every single idea was fully explored and fleshed-out RoboCop 2 would have been 4 hours long. In my opinion each thread has just enough for keen viewers and fans to appreciate. Lazy viewers only see what they want to see and I feel that this has led to many of the negative reviews the film has been met with (which usually comment on how \\\\\"offensive\\\\\" the character of Hob is-sheesh, gimme a break). And don\\'t give me that the \\\\\"humanity\\\\\" of the first film is gone. Murphy has not resigned to being a machine. He lies to pacify OCP. Pay attention to the very last line of dialogue in the film if you want proof.Filmed once again in Texas, Houston this time, you really have to feel for Peter Weller walking around in that Robosuit. It must have weighed a ton and he\\'d be sweating bucketloads inside. There is a particular scene in the film where Murphy is tortured into near-death/destruction that is very hard to watch. But it does lead to him getting a brand-new makeover and those crazy new directives put into his head. The bit where he lectures the Little League kids and scolds the youngsters playing by the leaky fire hydrant (after quoting some very suspicious philosophy) is hilarious.RoboCop 2 is a great movie. Despite harsh critisisms of the script and story and some slightly dated stop-motion effects it\\'s a brilliant sequel that lives up to expectations. Do listen to the nay-sayers. I don\\'t know what kind of film they were expecting.And thank you for not smoking!',\n",
       " \"I think this was the only Rocky film I never saw at the theater. I guess I'd had enough by then. However, I did catch this on VHS and, despite all the negative opinions I had read concerning it, I was glad I saw it. It was typical Rocky entertainment: hokey but satisfying and generally enjoyable.Richard Gant did a nice job impersonating Don King and Tommy Morrison, a real-life fighter, turned out to be a pretty good actor. Again, we see the familiar characters of Rocky, still sounding stupid; wife Adrian, older-looking but still faithful to her husband, and Paulie, still a slob and a low-life.The final scene provides the usual over-done fight with.....well, if you've seen the others and enjoyed them - the fights and the stories - you should like this, too.\",\n",

And, as usual, he gives a performance to be equalled by none.Sean Penn is marvelous, too, and Harris portrays evil incarnate.This film should be re-evaluated, and Gary Oldman should have received the Oscar for it. His portrayal of Jackie Flannery, a wild, violent young gangster with an ethereal tender streak - is simply phenomenal.',\n",

It has a remarkably funny gun crazed survivalist couple played completely straight-faced by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire. It has a wonderfully batty bunch of \\\\\"townsfolk,\\\\\" a winsome heroine and bad lot of underground drag racing worms looking to eat the characters mentioned above. The movie stands out from the \\\\\"trapped and pursued\\\\\" genre because it contains tongue-in-cheek humor, comedic escapes, inspired foreshadowing of doom and nutty monster mayhem. This is a delightful B monster movie that would best be watched with fellow funny movie buffs, popcorn and beer.',\n",
       " 'The worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) dreams on Mars for many consecutive nights. He invites his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) to spend vacation on Mars, but she does not agree, since the planet ruled by the tyrant Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who sells oxygen for the population, is facing resistance movement and terrorist acts leaded by the mutant Kuato. Douglas decides to go to the Rekall Company to implant virtual vacation memories of Mars for his own satisfaction, using a special program with the identity of a secret agent. While in the process, something goes wrong and Douglas becomes aggressive, and the process is interrupted. While returning home, the life of Douglas turns upside down, and he travels to the red planet trying to disclose who he is.Today I have watched \\\\\"Total Recall\\\\\" at least for the tenth time, now on DVD. Again, I found it an excellent sci-fi film with non-stop action. The story has many twists, and the screenplay has no flaws, being very attractive. This was the first movie that the beauty of the unknown Sharon Stone (in 1990) called my attention. Arnold Schwarzenegger is great performing a dubious hero, and Michael Ironside is the perfect villain. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \\\\\"O Vingador do Futuro\\\\\" (\\\\\"The Avenger of the Future\\\\\")',\n",
       " \"Wild at Heart begins with an arresting scene of bloody violence by one of the two lead characters, Sailor Ripley, and this immediately grabs our attention. After this he hooks up with his lover, Lula, who he fiercely protects, and goes on a bizarre road trip into the deep south of the states, while avoiding Lula's mother, played with passion by a deservedly Oscar-nominated Diane Ladd, who has an obsessive hatred for Sailor. They meet an assortment of weird people, especially Bobby Peru, and also Perdita Durango, who has appeared recently in a film with her name as the title, also written by Barry Gifford. It is classic David Lynch, with a homage type theme to the Wizard of Oz. It has the sensuality and eroticism later seen in Lost Highway, the violence and gore, the head sequence after the bank robbery being graphic, and a general uneasiness throughout. But it is a darkly humorous and transfixing piece.\",\n",
       " 'Recipient of the prestigious Palme d\\'Or award at Cannes, David Lynch\\'s \\\\\"Wild at Heart\\\\\" is an amazingly brilliant spectacle for the senses. Bold splashes of deep red, curiously staged musical numbers (Nicolas Cage does his own singing \\\\u0096 and he\\'s great!), and the continuous references to \\\\\"The Wizard of Oz\\\\\" help create a surreal and dreamlike texture to the narrative. The story in brief: Sailor and Lula (excellent performances from both Nicolas Cage &amp; Laura Dern); two broken souls passionately in love, flee the vengeful wrath of Lula\\'s mother Marietta, who for reasons of her own will stop at nothing to ensure the lovers are kept apart. Diane Ladd practically steals the show in her brave portrayal of Lula\\'s psychopathic mother Marietta. Gut wrenchingly violent in places, hopelessly romantic in others; Lynch has crafted an adult fairy tale worthy of multiple viewings. Recommended to those who enjoy and appreciate abstract methods of film-making \\\\u0096 a definite 10/10!',\n",
       " \"When you make a film like Begotten you know it will divide people - one man's trash is another man's art.  I don't think Begotten is trash and I'm not sure if it's art but I do know that it haunted me long after I saw it.This is completely unlike any film you'll ever see.  The graininess of it and the fact that you can't always make out what's going on just ups the creep out factor.  It's like watching a vague memory or a disjointed nightmare play out on film.On the downside, at only 68 minutes, it's still way too long.

You see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. Throw a Bruce Willis or a Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity, only it's Bill and Ted. This is a tricky fence to balance on, but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy, but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure, it becomes so much more.\",\n",

This movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. We can all relate with the suffering of the Beast (being an outsider), and we all know a Gaston in our lives.

       " '(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \\\\\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\\\\" Get it at Amazon.)Raise the Red Lantern is one of the most extraordinarily beautiful movies I have ever seen. The sets are exquisite tableaux carefully arranged, decorated and framed, and then shot from an attractive angle. The scene as they drag the third mistress, kicking and screaming to the tower of death, with the snow falling so peacefully onto the rooftops was chilling in its effect. The startling blaze of color, light and detail within the houses set against the drab simplicity of the courtyards, continually provided a contrast between life within the protection and at the favor of the master, and life without. This dichotomy is symbolized in the vibrant red lamps and the somber blue hue of the lamps when they are covered. In this manner, the mistresses are controlled. I was also struck by the sonorous beauty of the accompanying Chinese music.But more compelling than the beauty of the film is the story Director Zhang Yimou tells, a tale of paternity and imperious privilege set in early twentieth century China. He begins with the newly arrived fourth mistress, 19-year-old Songlian, a university student who, because of the death of her father, is forced to quit school. She chooses to marry a man of wealth. She is warned by her stepmother that she will be a concubine. She replies, isn\\'t that our fate? Her cynicism and then her robust energy in seeking her ascendancy over the other sisters engages us and we identify with her struggle.What is extraordinary about Zhang\\'s direction is how easily and naturally the personalities of the characters are revealed. The first mistress (\\\\\"big sister\\\\\") is too old to be of any sexual interest to the master, yet she is the mother of the eldest son. The second mistress, who has given the master only a daughter, still dreams of having a son. Her devious schemes and plots are hidden by smiles and fake good will toward her sisters. The third mistress, an opera singer still vibrant and beautiful (in a fascinating performance by the intriguing Caifei He), uses her allure in vying for the master\\'s attention. Songlian, in spite of herself, finds herself caught up in the competition with the others.Gong Li, who plays Songlian, is very beautiful with a strength of character that one quite naturally admires. She has the gift, as does, for example, Julia Roberts, of being able to express a wide range of emotion with just a glance of her very expressive face.Serving as a foil to the mistresses, and perhaps as the most poignant victim of the concubine system, is the servant girl Yan\\'er, played with a compelling veracity by Kong Lin. She is occasionally (how shall I say this for Amazon?) \\\\\"touched,\\\\\" to use Songlian\\'s term, by the master, and so she dreamed of being the fourth mistress. But when the fourth mistress arrives, her dreams are shattered, and in her jealousy she hates Songlian and plots against her. One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when Songlian, thinking Yan\\'er has stolen her flute, forces open the servant girl\\'s room and finds it flooded with.... Well, you should see.Note well that the master is only hazily observed. He is a personage, a man of wealth. That is enough to know about him. He is as interchangeable as the harem masters on a beach of elephant seals. But because he has wealth, he can engage concubines who must compete with one another through him to find their station in life. One gets a sense of what it might be like in the harem system practiced by gorillas and the sheiks and warlords of old. One pleases the master not because one loves the master (although one does of course because humans tend to love their masters) but because in pleasing the master one rises above the others. Thus the triumphant call, \\\\\"Light the lanterns in the third house!\\\\\"Most people no doubt lament the life of the mistresses. Yet women in poor places may wish such a life upon themselves. But concubines are just prostitutes, really, one might say, trapped by a system of male privilege. But I would remind those who see only that, that for every wife the \\\\\"master\\\\\" has, that is one wife another man will not have. The system does NOT favor males. It favors wealth and privilege. In such a system there are many men without wives, fomenting unrest, which is why modern states forbid polygamy.What does a man do with the capital he accumulates or inherits? If the system allows, he spends it on women and the assurance of his paternity. And why is that possible? Because many women--Songlian is our example--would rather be the fourth wife of a rich man than the first and only wife of a poor man. Many women would rather be used by a man of wealth than rule the household of a nerd. This is the way humans are, and any sexist interpretation of this movie misses this truth.The real horror depicted here, though, is in the brutality used to maintain the system, not in the polygamy itself. The women who follow the rules and beget the master\\'s children, especially if they are sons, enjoy a pampered and secure existence Those who do not are dealt with severely, branded as mad, or even murdered. Note the similar experience of the wives of Henry VIII, for example, within the English system of serial monogamy. This is a great movie, like a timeless novel fully realized, directed by a visual genius, from a script of great psychological power. Don\\'t miss this one. It\\'s one of the best ever made.',\n",

It tells the story of Louison (Dominique Pinon) who is the new helper of a landlord named Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus). Clapet is a butcher and in a world where food is rare he prepares cannibalistic meals for the people in his building. Louison is the new meal and the people in the building wait for Clapet to kill him so they can eat. Clapet's daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls in love with Louison and to save him she seeks help from an underground group.You have read the above and you must understand 'Delicatessen' is not a normal movie. Although its subject is close to very scary the movie is a comedy and to be honest it is very funny at times. Listen to the way people talk here. Especially the conversation between the butcher and a mailman is very funny. The underground group gets a lot of laughs as well. The movie hints at real horror images but never gives us that. Most of the time the tension is broken with something funny.'Delicatessen' is not only pretty funny, it looks terrific as well. From the great opening sequence to the last shot it is visually perfect. The production design and especially the cinematography add a lot to the movie's whole atmosphere. May be it is not for everyone, some will find it ridiculous or the idea too lugubrious, may be it is, but the way the subject is handled is the right way. At least it is interesting and therefore already worth seeing.\",\n",

When it gets reported that the man had done this after a remark by Lucas, Jack knows that his career is over, but also realizes how he has been affecting people.Some years later, Jack is wondering the streets and meets Parry (Robin Williams), a homeless man whose mind is gone. Parry believes Jack to be a sort of hero and Jack can\\'t get him to think otherwise. So, the two accompany each other from then on.Probably the movie\\'s most interesting aspect was how director Terry Gilliam shows what is happening in Parry\\'s imagination, contrasting it with reality.

Garry Marshall did a great job directing this movie and Terrence McNally translated his play to screen beautifully. All the characters in this movie could have had a film of their own. My favorite character is Nathan Lane's portrayal of the gay neighbor. Lane is very funny and I love the way his character encourages Pfeiffer's character to fall in love. Falling in love can be dangerous, exciting, scary and blissful all in one night. This movie captures love in a way that made me feel really good.\",\n",

These are accomplished in a major way.The main center of the comedy, the valise, gets treated in a way that gets a bit old, but overall, I can\\'t get tired of this movie. Stallone does such fantastic comedy and has such an exquisite sense of timing and delivery, it\\'s a wonder anybody lets him do action movies. He missed his calling.

The sets are great, the story is 40s, the cars, the cafe with the bizarre little gingerbread giving an impression of a gnome's hangout, the costumes, the hero with his wiffle hair style, the airplanes and even Howard Hughes.  What more could you want?  No, this isn't The Matrix with a lot of slick computer effects with mind twisting is it or isn't it real.  It's clear who the bad guys are-- and they're bad, except when, of course, the mob types are swept away by patriotic feelings and fight the Nazis.  It's got it all.

       " 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a movie that I\\'ve watched since I was a little girl and I still to this day absolutely adore it. Now granted I know that there was a few flaws with this film as I grew up and noticed that maybe Kevin Costner\\'s accent wasn\\'t so British or Christian Slater\\'s. But if we all always complained about accents, I think we wouldn\\'t enjoy movies as much. I love Robin Hood because it has action, adventure, romance, horror, magic, everything you can imagine is in this film. Not to mention that I think we got pretty darn good performances. My personal favorite is out of Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham, he is absolutely hilarious and a terrific villain. This is my favorite Robin Hood story of all time.Robin of Locksley, an English nobleman, is captured and jailed in a dungeon in Jerusalem along with his comrade, Peter. With their execution inevitable, Robin engineers an escape, saving the life of a Moor, Azeem in the process; Peter dies in the attempt and has Robin swear to protect his sister Marian. Robin makes the long journey back to England with Azeem, who claims he must accompany Robin until the debt of saving his life is repaid. In England, with King Richard I gone, the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham rules over the land with fear, aided by his brute cousin, Guy of Gisbourne along with the precognitive evil witch, Mortianna , and the corrupt Bishop of Hereford. At Locksley castle, Robin\\'s kind father Lord Locksley has been killed by the Sheriff\\'s men, after refusing to join them for the Sheriff\\'s unknown but treacherous scheme. Robin and Azeem arrive to find Robin\\'s formerly luxurious abode of Locksley Castle destroyed and his father, murdered. Lord Locksley\\'s loyal servant, Duncan, has survived, though his eyes were removed. With his lands and reputation gone Robin swears to avenge his father\\'s murder. Robin then begins by seeking out, Maid Marian, the cousin of the king and his childhood friend. He is immediately attracted to Marian, although she does not return the feelings, which poses a problem because Nottingham also has his sights set on her. While Robin, Azeem and Duncan escape the revenge seeking Gisboune and his soldiers, they seek shelter in the Forest of Sherwood, where they come across Little John, and a large group of woodsmen, all of whom were outlawed through the tyranny of the Sheriff. After proving his skill in single combat, Robin is accepted into their group and eventually becomes their leader, though Will Scarlet, one of Robin\\'s men, is constantly undermining his leadership. Robin encourages his men to fight back against Nottingham and begins to train them to defend themselves while they build weapons and homes in the forest, it\\'s their time \\\\\"to take it back\\\\\".If you haven\\'t seen Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves I highly recommend that you do, honestly I don\\'t know why anyone would not enjoy this film just a little bit. Like I said, it has everything to make a film great. My favorite scene, hard to choose from so many, is the ending battle scene where they discover that Robin Hood is alive and he is there at the castle to save his beloved Marian, it\\'s a great scene that keeps you on the edge of your seat. So please just get past the accents, give this movie a chance, it\\'s a terrific story and a wonderful movie that I will still watch and probably will even more so as I grow older. Besides I have to just to see Alan Rickman threaten Robin Hood with a spoon, lol, greatest threat ever.10/10',\n",

Notably from Michael McShane as Friar Tuck and Alan Rickman as the evilly comic Sheriff of Nottingham.The pace of the film rarely slackens, building up to a rip roaring finish.Enjoy.',\n",
       " \"I think most people tend to overlook how well-done the first 20 minutes of this movie really are. Ruben carefully builds a creepy atmosphere, relying on brief glances, moments of silence and quietly expressive performances (especially by Julia Roberts) to help the viewer understand that, behind the image of a perfect couple, something is really wrong. Unfortunately, after Roberts escapes from her husband, the movie turns into a strictly by-the-numbers thriller, where you can predict almost every development of the script. It's a visually polished movie, though, and the very good performances give it a strong psychological center that keeps it above-average.\",\n",

It may be difficult for some men to cross the gender boundary and connect with Thelma and Louise, yet doing so is critical to appreciating the film.  If you can make the connection then you can get its message -- we all need a friendship like the one Thelma and Louise had.  This movie will strike a deep emotional chord.....if you aren't afraid to let it.

       " \"I was roughly 10 years old when this film first hit the theaters. And when I saw it, I fell in love with it, maybe that should have been a warning that I wouldn't like it much once I've reached maturity.Fast Forward 13 years, and being nostalgic as I am, I decide to watch all 3 Terminator movies in order for old times sake. I couldn't believe the surprise I felt when I found out how horrible this film was. It's earlier installment was a masterpiece, even with the fraction of the budget that James Cameron had for this film. The second incarnation of the Terminator series totally ignores what made the 1st one so good, and instead replaces it as a popcorn, 50's esquire comic book style filming trying to appeal to kids and people with vocabularies limited to 4 lettered words. And it did very well in dumbing down Teriminator into the mess it was in Terminator 2.James Cameron made the biggest amateur mistake with this film in that they made the Terminator into this cheesy compassionate good guy character, which was not only ludicrous, but also very laughable. The potential for irony was strong with a boy growing so attracted to a cold, emotionless machine, as well as the irony of a machine being the ideal protector as opposed to the father John never had. Yet all of this was wasted on this half-assed 'almost human' machine who gives funny one liners and smiles.As if this wasn't enough to destroy this film, We're also treated to an Edward Furlong being well timed into his changing voice. Hearing a squeaky annoying child's voice swearing and trying to act tough which will the audience petition for a mute button in the theaters. I can understand Linda Hamilton's character's transformation from a naive waitress into a more hardened and tough woman after battling a terminator before. There's no chemistry between John and Sarah in the movie, And Furlong's portrayal seemed so plain and simple for such a troubled and traumatized child he was supposed to depict.The only good things in this film is perhaps the action and the eye-candy. Both of which is very nice to see but the slop of a plot and character use. Terminator 1 was obviously a B movie, But the plot, the mood and the rational use of characters made it thought provoking as well as frightening. Terminator 2 feels as if it's trying to make violence and cheap thrills with a Disney touch behind it.He did this with the Titanic as well. Tsk task.\",\n",

The plot. There is some kind of plot but mostly it\\'s just there so that we can get to the special effects. And finally the acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS. The John O\\' Connor kid is so amazingly bad that I muted this movie every time he started talking. A high-pitched kid swearing and trying to act big and bad is the last thing I am entertained by. Arnold Schwarzzeneger and John O\\' Connor\\'s mother put on performances not quite as bad as the kid but close. I do not see how anyone could like this movie, but apparently some people do.

The films are horribly written movies about machines coming back from the future to destroy a guy who is supposed to be all that and a box of cracker jacks. He isn't. In this movie, he's a brat to beat all brats, even for a kid. You just hope he gets killed and the movie ends. None of the characters are likable. The idea of time travel to change the future could be done better than in this movie series by a two year old kid. There's a lot of noise that passes for action, but the action is shot in such a way that you don't really know what's going on. This is how not to make a movie. Too bad you can't vote negative numbers for junk like this. If you haven't seen it, believe me, you aren't missing a thing.\",\n",
       " 'The real story of Columbus is an adventure story with plenty of plot twists and interesting characters. So there was no need to fabricate history in this film. We have Columbus\\' journals that tell us what happened when he landed in the new world and the events that followed. This film set an agenda to make Columbus out to be a visionary who against the odds made good and the only problem was that everyone else didn\\'t have his insight. Ridiculous! Columbus did something quite amazing in sailing to the new world but that doesn\\'t mean that he didn\\'t have serious flaws. For one, in the film he speaks about a \\\\\"New World\\\\\" but Columbus died believing he actually had found a passage to Asia so for him there was nothing new about it. The first encounter with the natives is also ridiculous in the film. In Columbus\\' journal we see that naked villagers came out onto the beach and that Columbus claimed the land for Spain and then took out his sword and tested the natives\\' knowledge of weapons. They had none and Columbus actually cut them. In the movie, Columbus is just walking through the jungle and he is approached by hostile natives ready to fire their arrows at him. He tells his men who are about to open fire to stop and that they must act peacefully. So Columbus becomes the peacemaker when in reality the natives were peaceful and he drew his sword on them. There are tons of these moments in the movie that make this movie a joke in terms of history. If directors are going to use real historical figures they need to represent them accurately. If they want to imagine or reimagine the colonial experience then they should use fictional characters.',\n",

       " \"Not in the same league as the first 2 Alien films. The special effects were well done, and while the action scenes were excellent, there weren't nearly enough of them. Nothing against director David Fincher, but I would not put him in the same class as Ridley Scott and James Cameron (directors of the first 2 films). This movie did not have a great flow. For the better part of an hour, we're left listening to dull dialogue, before the action picks up. At least with the first Alien film, the suspense kept up the pace of the movie. Also, aside from Lt. Ripley, none of the other characters are the least bit interesting in this film. This movie is enjoyable, and better than a many sci-fi movies out there, but I would not consider this one to be a classic.\",\n",
       " '(SPOILERS ALERT)I know I\\'m in the minority on this, but I hated this chapter with the fire of a thousand suns.  This was just such a disappointing direction for the series to go in -- I\\'m a huge fan of Alien and Aliens, and I walked out of Alien3 halfway through the first time I saw this, when I saw what they\\'d done to the lovely ending of Aliens. James Cameron made a fantastic, thrilling, pulse-pounding film with the second one, gave Ripley a well-deserved happy ending (complete with a new family) -- and this film goes and takes a dump all over it. It just seemed like a pointless and cruel choice for the series to go in.Fincher may be a prodigiously talented director -- no argument, I\\'m a huge fan of his other work -- but in this case it\\'s all overblown, overdone -- it feels more to me like a \\\\\"look what I can do\\\\\" film exercise than a Scifi film.  I just wish the film had paid half as much attention to the script as Fincher does in setting up his shots. Fancy, too-long shots of blood spattering in slo-mo, predictable artsy shadows for the alien to lurk in, etc -- even upon rewatching this (it\\'s taken me three times simply to make it to the end), I just didn\\'t care, and it\\'s obvious the filmmakers don\\'t either.  It\\'s very cold, characters are dispatched on schedule, and oh, look at the pretty slomo.On the good side, the acting is uniformly fine, with Weaver fantastic as always in a totally thankless role, and the cinematography is really gorgeous. People get slaughtered right and left but at least it\\'s by candlelight.Ultimately, what bothered me most (and still does) was Alien3\\'s underlying humiliation of Ripley -- it was like they went out of their way to rob her of all previous happiness, then further degrade, debase, and humiliate the character until she dies a gruesome, painful and unhappy death.  Um, OK. Nice ending.Anyway, all you Fincher fans will probably throw things at me, but count me in as one of the minority who hated this.  (I still love the rumor mill that says Joss Whedon\\'s first draft of Alien Resurrection was to simply make all of Alien3 a dream.  Works for me!)',\n",
       " 'This is by far, the worst of the Alien series.  The idea is kinda neat, but the execution was just really bad.  There is no suspense, no terror, and I really did not care if Ripley made it through this one or not.  The most disapointing thing to me is that they never explored the mutation, if that was what it was of the Alien in the prison, what was different about it. The only reason to see this is so that you can go on to the final installment of the Alien series.',\n",
       " 'Agreed, it was just about the hardest thing in the world to follow-up after Alien and Aliens but did it have to be this bad? Instead of expanding on the premise, all Fincher does is go back to just one Alien-threat. And all that ever happens is some running around in corridors and some shrieking music, which makes for a poor attempt to achieve the same atmosphere as in Alien. Fincher also tries to rob us of any future alien-installments in the climax but luckily they went ahead and did it anyway with Alien: Resurrection.',\n",
       " 'First off, I\\'d like to say that had Alien and Aliens never been filmed, Alien3 would\\'ve made a good movie just as it is. Unfortunately the reality is that since both of the first 2 movies were great, this movie had high expectations. Ultimately, Alien3 is not worthy to be accepted as part of Alien series.Alien3 had some good acting and music and some excellent cinematography I thought. It was also darker than the first 2. Also, the concept of crashing in a maximum security prison was a good one I thought. But since this review only rationalizes a 3/10 for this movie, I will spend the rest of the time explaining what made this movie a bad one.First of all, it completely ruins the second Alien movie for three reasons: Firstly by introducing the egg that had been on board that had hatched into an alien. How the heck did that egg get there anyway? No explanation is offered. Secondly by introducing the fact that Ripley somehow had a queen alien chestburster inside of her. How did that get there? No explanation is offered. Thirdly by killing off 2 of the main characters from \\\\\"Aliens\\\\\", Newt and Hicks, right at the very beginning, giving them senseless deaths. Many say this was for \\\\\"shock value\\\\\". Shock value my ass, it was just a letdown. Killing them off halfway through or something would\\'ve been more effective. Besides, they could\\'ve developed Newt and Hicks a lot more. The sole fact that the innocent child Newt has to live in a maximum security prison makes for some good character development. Hicks would\\'ve been a bit trickier, but with some creativity they could\\'ve come up with something (i.e. maybe Hicks went to prison when he was younger and he\\'s scared of them now and has to deal with it). Maybe if Hicks and Newt were the first victims, it would\\'ve been more satisfying (and then Ripley would be a loner again, which is what her character is all about IMO, as nobody would believe her about the alien again, etc).Another element lacking in the third movie is the absence of one of the dominant themes in the first 2 movies, about the protection of the innocent. Ripley went out of her way to protect Jones (in Alien) and Newt (in Aliens) but there was none of her \\\\\"motherly\\\\\" role in this movie. I felt this element was important to the first 2 movies, yet it became non-existent in the third.Another negative point was that I feel this movie sort of ruined the image of the alien. Having the alien run after people at high velocities and having the people herd it like a sheep is not what the alien is supposed to be. The aliens are supposed to be slow, sneaky, and stealthy and pop out from behind you when you least expect it. By making the alien run, they were trying to make it scarier, but they actually made it less scary. Come to think of it, the scariest bad guys in movies are never fast moving creatures. And the aliens are supposed to be smart, not stupid. Remember in Alien how the alien was hiding in the escape ship at the end? Or in Aliens how the queen used the elevator and then stowed away? A final point that made this movie bad was a stupid stylistic decision: Kill off the main secondary character, Clemens, halfway through the movie. They had just begun to develop his character, and he could\\'ve been the next Hicks or Newt, but no, they kill him off halfway through. Then instead they try to develop the character of Dillon, however, they only get to developing his character halfway through as well. As a result, we have 2 half-developed characters (both of which die by the end), leaving Ripley the only character the viewer really cares about (unlike in Aliens where we had Hicks, Newt, Bishop, Vasquez, Apone, etc).In conclusion, this was a well made movie with terrible stylistic decisions that essentially ruined it. The only good decision was to have Ripley sacrifice herself for the protection of humans at the end. This was done very well and ended off the movie well (albeit it was a sad ending).',\n",
       " \"I seem to remember when I watched this a while ago that I really liked it, and also that it was one of the best in the series. It seems that I was really stupid back then.This movie is horrible. Awful. Terrible. I honestly was surprised at how poorly I reacted to it. I love Fincher, I love the Alien series, I have good memories of enjoying this movie, but this movie is still very poor.Apparently, it isn't much Fincher's fault that it didn't work out so well, what with the studio control issue and whatever, but a lot of what I find distasteful in this film is the Fincher element. This movie is very nihilistic, antimaterialistic, and strongly airs a lot of Fincher's later work. I wouldn't mind it so much, in fact I'd rather enjoy it, except that it messes up Ripley's character too much.In each movie she changes. In the first, she starts out almost completely genderless until the end while in the second she's very motherly. In this one, she's pretty much just despicable. In a way it makes sense... if you kept going through revolving periods of stasis and action--LITERALLY--you'd become a cynical nihilist as well. But this was overdone and unbelievable, not to mention ruined by her very out of character sleeping with the doctor. It doesn't fit, and it makes the ending even worse with her martyrism. Nothing's worse than a nihilist martyr.Anyway, it would make up for it with wonderful visuals if it weren't for the fact that the graphics have aged poorly. The CGI alien, though good for the time, is so bad by today's standards that it's ultimately unbelievable. It's sad that that has happened, but honestly there's no denying it. Apparently Fincher was trying for another psychological horror like the first one (an approach I agree with, considering the second one was pretty much a dull action film), but he shows too much and makes it too bloody. Most of the time the CGI wasn't even needed anyway. Whatever.Finally, I couldn't stand any of the other characters. Their religiosity, their Australian accents, all of that stuff really didn't add anything but a resounding sense of fatigue. It was a risky approach; if it succeeded it would have been awesome. It didn't.This is the worst part of the series.--PolarisDiB\",\n",
       " \"I am one of the people who doesn't dislike this film because it is different, but because it wasn't different enough. Oh no, there is an alien behind you. Look out, it is picking you off one by one. I really didn't think it even tried to do something else. I would've preferred Alien 4 to this one if that one wasn't campy. However, if you liked the first Alien the best out of all the movies, you will probably enjoy this film more than I did. I just kinda enjoyed the combat of Aliens more than the thriller movies. However, Alien was one of the first to do this, so it is a testament to the timelessness of it's concept which we younger viewers take for granted.\",\n",

That right there is enough to p*** me off. This movie could have been so much better than this. And come on now, a prison setting? Please.

       " 'Wow... where to start on this movie. I think this one REALLY just killed the series. First off, by killing of Hicks, Newt, and kind of Bishop at the very start. Plus there were so many plot devices it was scary. The characters had no depth to them, except for Ripley, Dillon, Clemens, and maybe Aaron. They tried to make you care about them, EG after the quinacetraline explosion, when they have the sad-toned music, and the prisoners who survived walk slowly down the halls finding the dead ones and taking them away. Kind of like the \\\\\"Bring out your dead\\\\\" scene in Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail, except not funny. But, they\\'re prisoners! Why would you honestly care about them?! And the movie itself was just plain BORING. Everything was either silver or sepia toned, there were long periods where absolutely nothing happens, but this is different from Alien\\'s case. The first movie, there are long uneventful periods, because it adds to the creep factor. In this, they\\'re there because they want to save the few action sequences for the end. However, I will say in it\\'s defense, I liked the ending. A different turn from the first to, and rather poignant. Seeing as there\\'s this woman who is tormented every *waking* moment of her life by these alien creatures, and she finally has no choice but to give up. But all and all, a very weak entry to the series. I don\\'t like David Fincher. Now, the special edition is SO MUCH BETTER! All that extra stuff they cut out made the film much more watchable! Golic going crazy, releasing the alien, and all that extra stuff. For me, it raised the watch-ability rate to about a 6.5 rather than a 4! In conclusion, if you\\'re going to see Alien3, see the special edition, NOT the theatrical!',\n",
       " 'This is my first film review on IMDb, so I\\'m going to brief you on how I\\'ll write my reviews from now on. First, I\\'ll go through the positive attributes of a film (if any), followed by the negative attributes (if any). Then I\\'ll end the review with 3 choice words that describe what I thought or how I feel about the film. With that out of the way, I\\'ll start my review of the third (and what should have been the final) installment of the Alien franchise.The positives: -I like the look and style of the film, even though some of the areas of the prison look the same. Since this is a David Fincher film, though, that\\'s to be expected. -I still love Ripley, and I like all the moments of the film between her and the characters that actually get developed (except the warden, he\\'s just annoying). -I love the musical score of the film, and it\\'s possibly the best score of all the Alien films. It\\'s officially dented into my brain. -I think the film\\'s ending is great, with the exception of the chestburster coming out of Ripley while she takes the Nestea plunge into molten lead (How can she grab onto it? She should be dead the instant it bursts out!).The Negatives: -Not a single moment of this film is frightening. We see all the \\\\\"scares\\\\\" coming, when they should be unexpected. It seems that the filmmakers instead decided to make the deaths more graphic, which just makes these scenes repulsive (I find the chestburster coming out of the dog very distasteful). -WHY DID THEY KILL HICKS AND NEWT AT THE START OF THE MOVIE?! I realize that I\\'m sounding like a whiny fanboy right now, but this is a slap in the face to James Cameron, the numerous fans of \\\\\"Aliens\\\\\", and me! They had all of this potential by keeping them alive, but they flushed it down the crapper anyway. What a waste. -The new characters other than Clemens and Dillon are one-dimensional bald guys with no character definition. They only seem to be there so they can get killed by the alien. -The visual effects are a mixed bag (how they got an Academy Award nomination is beyond me). While some effects look pretty good, others look obvious or below average, and the aforementioned chestburster coming out of Ripley almost looks cheesy.My 3 choice words: Frightless, Mediocre, Stylish',\n",
       " 'I am a big fan of the Alien series, and own both of the first two movies. After watching Alien 3 again recently though, I was reminded how horrible it was.  It was very cheap, and reminded me of a bad made-for-tv-movie.  It rearranged the rules that were set up in the first two movies, and switched all sorts of things around.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen.',\n",
       " \"One major beef I had with Alien3 was the condescension on Ellen Ripley's part, namely the scene where she is chastising the warden for not having weapons of any sort (it is a prison planet after all, and given its circumstances, hardly not understandable.) Overall, I found the movie bothersome and annoying, an unnecessary sequel that offered little to the mythology or to the moviegoer.\",\n",
       " 'Alien^3 is a textbook example of how too much studio control can destroy a potentially decent film. After the massive success of Aliens, the studio wanted yet another film to bring in more profit. That makes perfect sense to me. If you have a good thing going then why not milk it? But here\\'s the problem: Aliens ended with very little wiggle room in which to make another film. For all intents and purposes, it was the end of the story. As Alien^3 went through various drafts, the numerous writers attempted to bring new things into the story regarding the aliens. For example, William Gibson\\'s screenplay had the idea of the aliens having an alternate means of reproduction via spores. A very neat idea, mind you, and the descriptions of the transformations in the script would\\'ve made for very horrific imagery on film.Unfortunately, Alien^3 decided to throw any good ideas out the window and magically place an alien egg aboard our heroes\\' ship, despite the fact that in the previous film we are shown that the Queen has left her eggs at the hive.And I\\'m just getting warmed up.Another common gripe about Alien^3 is the death of the characters Newt and Hicks. Many fans of the film felt that it was necessary and that it helped eliminate the \\\\\"happy ending\\\\\" of Aliens. I personally don\\'t think it was a bad idea to kill off the characters, except that it was executed poorly on screen. Their deaths carried no meaning other than to forcefully make Ripley a fish out of water again. Not only that, but Newt and Hicks (who were engaging characters) are replaced by uninteresting stock characters who serve no other purpose than to be cannon fodder. Now the previous two films had their share of cannon fodder, but they at least left you wondering who exactly was going to die. Example: few suspected that Ripley would be the sole survivor of Alien.Lastly, people complain that Alien^3 was nothing more than a retread of the original film. That\\'s very true. Except that, unlike Alien, this film didn\\'t work. Instead we are treated to a rather formulaic slasher-like storyline. The ending is one of the few parts that truly work and it serves as an excellent bookend to the series.Director David Fincher, who was unfortunately reduced to the level of studio puppet, does manage to save the film with his talent in creating a moody atmosphere. One can only wonder how much better this film might have been had he been given a greater amount of control.Alien^3 could best be described as \\\\\"the great sequel that never was\\\\\". Given a more interesting script and more control on the director\\'s part, this film could\\'ve been at least as good as it\\'s predecessors. Fortunately, Fox took a step in the right direction with Alien Resurrection by having entertaining characters and a more original story.',\n",

Alien 3 didn't need to be told, the story wasn't convincing.  Perhaps the fatal flaw was setting it in a space prison.  It's hard to care for characters who are murderers and rapists.  I wouldn't waist the time to watch this but you should definitely watch the first two.\",\n",

But it isn't, it is the third of the Alien series, and as such, it is absolutely dreadful as it ruined what could have been the greatest series of Sci-Fi films of all time.Plotwise it is pencil thin, another person more imaginative might place the action on Earth with the aliens creating havoc, or a planet discovered to be the source of the aliens. The possibilities are endless, but what have we got instead? A woebegone prison on a misbegotten planet full of refugees from other films. There is nothing new or interesting about this film, just a lot of regurgitated stuff from earlier Alien films and filled with dreary characters. Worse that Ripley was killed off so you can't have anything but the turgid Resurrection. If the director wanted to make a statement or do a prison drama, he should really have done it with another films and not ruin this great series.Absolutely unforgivable!\",\n",

The characters in Aliens were one-dimensional also, but they didn\\'t pretend to be \\\\\"deep, thoughtful and complicated\\\\\". You have to admire the change in feel of the third alien outing, but did anyone read the script? It also seemed to short change the heroic accomplishments of the survivors of the second film to have them die in their sleep because they didn\\'t examine their ship properly before entering hypersleep, why did they need to sleep? Their ship was only 6 weeks out?... Maybe they could have found the alien homeworld or some military types could have smuggled some pods to earth or something... oh well now we have Alien v Predator because they wanted special effects and visuals to take the place of story... when will we have Alien v Predator v Jason v Freddy?',\n",

There is nothing new or innovative about this installment except for the fact that the alien is mixed with a dog or something. Lets just say this one plays out like the first one, but it is not as involving or as interesting. Weaver goes through the motions and that is the shame because she is the only actor you will recognize here with the exception of Lance. The story, Ripley lands on a space prison, alien tagged along, it starts killing, and the startling revelation why said alien will not kill her. Of course evil people want to use the alien again for weapon purposes. Why? Who knows, but I think it would be obvious by this time that the aliens are simply killing machines, and they are incapable of being trained. The ending is the lone bright spot here, but I was bored out of my mind by the time it rolled around.

First, there is no way that an egg (or eggs) made it onto the spaceship at the end of Aliens.  The queen didn\\'t lay any eggs anywhere (she was detached from her egg sack, remember?)

to be so authentic it hurts he even insisted on using historically accurate narrow gauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of cottage grove oregon most importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of buster on his train agilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind him to be filmed from another train running alongside buster his train and the camera are all in motion the wind whips through busters hair while smoky pine covered hills rise and fall around him these scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of moving pictures and they put to shame all later back projection and process shots models and computer generated effects the quality of keatons film making is simply pun intended unparalleled every shot in the general is clean fresh and efficiently composed the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times the film never tries to be beautiful its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and civil war uniforms the generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt all of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline adapting the historical incident keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train johnnie gray rather than one of the raiders as he saw immediately the general is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang first johnnie on a borrowed train the texas chases his own stolen train the general he manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command the general is not keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs a number of the gags like the box car that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long build up for a relatively modest payoff but the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings the cannon attached to the back of busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve riding on the cowcatcher buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way a forlorn buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motion i agree with author jim kline who describes the general as keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality in many of his films buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero but his competent ingenious and athletic character in the general who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature there is a shot in the general of busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white table cloth that has always reminded me of dziga vertovs kinoglaz the camera eye keaton melds with his camera theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies they have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humor the general might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy that as in chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately but no one knew what to make of the general original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing the general is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues like keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train the shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it who else in hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays he doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy anything so subtle will always leave some people cold but for those who can see the expressiveness of busters so called stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated buster keaton always has more than hes showing you can see it in his eyes ',\n",
       " 'let me join the consensus and call charlie chaplins city lights a masterpiece its only 81 minutes long but they are among the best 81 minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite keep your kleenex box at arms length as i doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film when the formerly blind girl gives the little tramp a flower and ultimately says yes i can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanation chaplin was at his zenith in 1928 when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the little tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade he had already made the classics the gold rush 1925 and the circus 1928 starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time the advent of talkies didnt stop chaplin from making this comedy romance in pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the little tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character what i particularly enjoyed in this film is how the little tramp fancies himself as a well mannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love it is this self delusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by virginia cherrill her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable simply compare her to the screen test shown of georgia hale chaplins leading lady in the gold rush and an obviously more experienced actress than cherrill as hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the little tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sight of course this would not be a chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a dvd extra inspired by an earlier chaplin short the champion from 1915 even a simple moment for example when the little tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment and special mention needs to go to chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves jos u00e9 padillas la violetta as his love theme the transfer to dvd is very good and the 2 dvd set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality the serge bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of chaplin from a vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the long forgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then the aforementioned georgia hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long the 10 minute home movie of chaplins trip to bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers ',\n",

       " 'dodsworth united artists 1936 directed by william wyler stars walter huston 1884 1950 in what is rightfully acclaimed to be his best screen performance in a motion picture career that spanned from 1929 until his death in 1950 recreating the role he originated on broadway in 1934 and based on the novel by sinclair lewis this samuel goldwyn production is a perfectly transferred masterpiece the story revolves around samuel dodsworth walter huston a millionaire industrialist of zenith ohio president and founder of dodsworth motor company who after twenty years of building up his automobile establishment sells it over to union motors and leaves the factory with fond memories of hard work behind him now retired he finds that he must succumb to his wife fran ruth chatterton whose main goal is to enjoy life starting with an extensive six month european vacation from london to paris while on their continental tour on the queen mary sam excites himself by seeing the world for the first time while his wife yearning for a more sophisticated existence tries to recapture her youth by winning admiration with younger or sophisticated men captain clyde lockert david niven and arnold iselin paul lukas a suave international banker each becoming short lived affairs as fran entertains herself without sam sam finds good company with edith cortright mary astor a american divorc u00e9e traveling alone what was originally intended to be a sort of second honeymoon for this middle aged couple sam and fran find that after years of marriage they have become strangers drifting apart fran becomes even more bitter when she learns that her now grown married daughter kathryn marlowe is expecting a child making fran to realize that she is to become a grandmother still deeply in love with fran sam is unwilling to profess to himself that she is a selfish woman trying to hold on to her youth but reluctantly consents to frans request to get a divorce traveling around the world alone sam reacquaints himself with edith cortright as for fran she finds love with the impoverished kurt von obersdorf gregory gaye with whom she plans to marry after meeting kurts aristocratic but strong willed mother maria ouspenskaya who is totally against this marriage fran becomes mortified when shes asked have you ever thought what it would be like to be the old wife of a young husband as for sam his life has become a renewed experience with edith at her italian villa until fran informs him she wants to come back into his life again walter huston more an actor than star makes a perfect dodsworth he even delivers the films most memorable line love has to stop someplace short of suicide ruth chatterton a capable actress whose career by then was then on the wane gives one of her best on screen performances in fact her last great performance ever recorded on film her classic moment is telling her husband sam youre rushing at old age im not ready for that yet sadly many of her previous screen efforts are overlooked and forgotten today years before cable television dominated the airwaves dodsworth appeared to be the only ruth chatterton movie in circulation on commercial or late night television while fay bainter who co starred opposite huston in the stage version of dodsworth would have been equally excellent in the role of fran chattertons performance nearly dominates without taking away from hustons performance at times she could become annoying but thats the essence to her character nominated for eight academy awards huston did get recognized for his performance as best actor as did the movie for best picture curiously ruth chatterton performance was overlooked by the judges of the academy whats even more ironic is that maria ouspenskaya making her movie debut in a performance that takes up no more than five minutes earned an award for best supporting actress the nomination that should have been offered to mary astor who not only has more screen time but is more essential to the story aside from that astor who was playing a woman some years older than her true age is strikingly beautiful and shares the films now many classic scenes including the one where she looks eye to eye at fran who claims to be 35 and telling her dont her one word says it all what also makes the movie succeed even after all these years is the frankness and very adult minded theme dealing with realities of mid life crisis next to paramounts make way for tomorrow 1937 dodsworth is the only known major motion picture of that time to bring out the realities of old age openly and honestly the alfred newman underscoring which sets the mood and dramatic appeal is also an added plus as well as part of the samuel goldwyn trademark supporting players include spring byington odette myrtil and john payne billed as john howard payne making his movie debut as harry emily dodsworths husband dodsworth became one of many samuel goldwyn features to be distributed to video cassette aside from its many revivals on commercial television since the 1970s dodsworth did enjoy frequent showings on cable televisions american movie classics in 1993 and more than a decade later premiered march 1 2004 on turner classic movies dodsworth winner of one academy award for which best art direction by richard day is the type of movie once seen its hard to forget and improves itself with repeated viewing producer samuel goldwyn accomplished in transporting a stage play into a cinematic achievement not once during its presentation did dodsworth have the appearance of a filmed stage play in spite that dodsworth in not becoming as better known as it deserves to be it still ranks one of the finest and most adult stories ever to be produced in the 1930s huston

stolen from million dollar movie million dollar movie is gone now but gone with the wind book and film remain eternal in these days margaret mitchells southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher let alone selling film rights to the story but it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyones mind who reads the novel or sees the film and thats just about the same because i cant think of another film that remained so faithful to the text it is said that margaret mitchell wrote the book with clark gable in mind as rhett butler as the sober and ever realistic but charming rhett gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen however in the last half hour of the film when hes hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently if mitchell knew who she wanted as rhett nobody knew who would be scarlett the search for scarlett ohara is one of those hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of edna may oliver read for the part gone with the wind started filming without a scarlett as the famous burning of atlanta sequence was done first while it was being down david o selznick settled on a fairly unknown british actress at least in the usa vivien leigh it was a stroke of casting genius vivien leighs screen output is pretty small she was primarily a stage actress gone with the wind is more her film than rhett butlers the story is her story how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living shes become accustomed to from the pre civil war era in the process she helps all those around her economically but loses all their previous affection ive always felt the key scene in the film is after leslie howard tells leigh hell be marrying olivia dehavilland and leigh makes a fool of herself with him she finds out that clark gable has overheard the whole thing hes fascinated by her but because of that hes on to all her ploys leslie howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads his ashley wilkes is not all that different from alan squire in the petrified forest imagine squire as a wealthy plantation owner and youve ashley hes stronger than he realizes though hes the one that reluctantly enlists in the confederate army while the cynical rhett butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner ive always felt however that the most difficult acting job in gone with the wind was the role of melanie hamilton olivia dehavilland after initially considering trying out for scarlett decided to go after melanie its a deceptive part superficially its a lot like the crinoline heroines dehavilland was doing at warner brothers melanie is the counterpoint to scarlett an incredibly kind and decent soul who cant see bad in anyone one of her best

up in a snood its clear that for mitchum good times are no longer in store the talent that went into out of the past is manifold both director of photography nicholas musuraca and roy webb who wrote

dialogue right down to paul valentine as one of douglas strong arms advising greer about to place a long distance call that those dames listen in but the most prestigious palm must go to tourneur he had less of a distinctive style to him u0096 less of a look less of a formula u0096 than most of the top flight noir directors he was a chameleon who used his talents less to make his own statement as to bring out the best in the scripts he was given he was born in france and he died in france but when in hollywood he brought neither technical innovation nor rigorous theory to his work rather he looked for the human element that underlies and informs art u0096 and he relished its complexity the movie for instance opens and closes on dickie moore as a teenaged deaf mute in mitchums employ and whose function in the story is far from a merely sentimental fillip tourneur took film noir as close to tragic poetry as it would ever come and out of the past his masterwork raised the standards of the noir cycle as far as they would ever go its not just one of the greatest noirs its one of the greatest movies period ',\n",

tightly focused ensemble piece heavy on dialogue and taking place primarily in one interior location the bad seed is one of the better but more understated horror films from the 1950s because of its ideas its unusual portrayal of a manipulatively evil child and a weirdly cute young girl at that and its nihilistic and abruptly mind blowing ending the bad seed was quite a shocking film in 1956 in my book it still is thats not to say that the film is graphic much more so than say the haunting 1963 the bad seed is the classic example of how something implied and not shown can be just as effective and disturbing as something shown still not everyone loves it of course staginess is often cited with either a direct claim or an implication that that quality is necessarily a flaw the bad seeds staginess is easily explicable it is a film adaptation of a play by maxwell anderson which was itself adapted from william marchs last novel published in 1954 its easy to see how only minor changes would allow the film to be performed on a stage however i dont see the bad seeds staginess as a flaw its not as if plays are bad merely for the fact that theyre plays right there seems to be some unspoken or unanalyzed attendant assumption that cinema shouldnt bear strong similarities to other artistic media and or a belief that cinema should always be naturalistic i dont agree with either of those assumptions cinema can do many different things it shouldnt all just be one way or another rather than being a flaw the staginess of the bad seed is an asset it catalyzed the effective tell dont show attitude towards the films violence it allows all attention to be placed on the fantastic ensemble performances and especially on mccormack who turns in the best young female performance this side of dakota fanning and it helps make the film feel like the parable that it is under director mervyn leroys hand the bad seed is an extended meditation on two philosophical ideas twisted psychologies and the nature versus nurture debate its not just rhoda who has psychologically rooted problems and dysfunctions but everyone in the film christine is in denial and shows that she has long been in denial about her happiness her life and her daughter she continually tries to act as if everything is kosher and normal but as the film progresses she has periodic cracks in the armor until the breakdown at the end and even in the midst of that she tries to act as if everything is okay and mundane monica who keeps trying to psychoanalyze everyone except the one person she most needs to psychoanalyze tends to also intellectually browbeat or overpower them kenneth is an absentee husband leroy jessup henry jones the apartment maintenance man presents himself as just as twisted deceptive and manipulative as rhoda and there is a pedophile subtext with the character claudia fern joan croydon the head of rhodas school seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown and also seems to be in denial as does christines father richard who also has elements of absenteeism and emotional distancing hortense daigle eileen heckart the mother of the drowned boy is an alcoholic and her tragedy puts her over the edge in fact the only character in the entire film who seems well adjusted is reginald and perhaps thats symbolic of his function as a criminologist the nature versus nurture material is incorporated in an unusual way characters debate this to an extent but most take the nurture side however the film itself makes more of an argument for the nature side and christine despite being in denial comes to believe the nature side as does reginald the even keeled character in fact william march the author of the novel believed more in the nature side and said as much to colleagues while he was working on the book including doing research into psychotic killers what helps to amp up the disturbing qualities of the film is that rhoda is manipulating the audience as well as she is manipulating other characters only very seldom does leroy have her true nature come through and its a shock to us in the same way that its a shock to the other characters the ending of the book was changed to be in line with the moral code for hollywood films at the time but the resultant somewhat bizarre ending is probably more shocking in retrospect than marchs original ending would have been there have been many horror films over the years with endings somewhat similar to marchs there havent been many that end in quite the same way that the bad seed does while the film would certainly require a bit of adjustment for many younger modern horror fans it is well worth watching especially if youve become acclimated to slower paced dramatic understated horror ',\n",

       " 'an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist instead of following the trial itself the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room the film begins with the end of the trial the jurors retire to deliberate the case a preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11 1 in favour of the guilty verdict eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father only juror 8 has doubts at first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes rightfully that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror 8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit as time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all but not everyone is easy to convince although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors the character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting excellent dialogue and near flawless acting juror 1 a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out he appears at ease only once during the film when he talks about football he has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury a task he clearly does not relish juror 2 a small quite man clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance apparently he finds solace in his job he is an accountant juror 3 probably the most complex personality in the film starts off like a pleasant self made successful businessman he analyses the case impartially explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured as time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case he also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability wonderfully played by lee j cobb this is the character you remember after the film is over juror 4 self assured slightly arrogant stockbroker obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but as one of the jurors says this is not an exact science he does not take into account the feelings the passions the characters of the people involved in the case he is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off it is a very hot day juror 5 here is a man under great emotional stress he comes from the same social background as the accused boy with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty he does not want compassion to influence him so ironically it does juror 6 a simple man quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations but he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake juror 7 the only one that really has no opinion on this case literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case he talks of baseball of the heat of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think its worth the bother juror 8 a caring man has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors he tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds juror 9 a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case juror 10 the most horrifying character in the film votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boys social background the tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boys which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference juror 11 an immigrant watchmaker careful methodical man well mannered and soft spoken respects the right of people to have different opinion to his and is willing to look at both sides of the problem loses his temper only once horrified by the complete indifference of juror 7 juror 12 a young business type perhaps he has his own opinions but is careful to hide them what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think the film succeeds in doing something very rare today developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable memorable and distinct characters ',\n",

       " '12 angry men is entertaining mostly well acted and worth a watch it could have been far better but from the outset the film was designed only to take a pot shot at the right and promote a left wing progressive viewpoint as the absolute truth this story is hardcore propaganda and judging by its score on imdb has succeeded in fooling a great number of people what is interesting to me is that the left wings brainwashing started this early hollywood is still churning out the same bias today go and read my dark knight review the movie has a very interesting premise an open and shut case is called in to question when one man on the twelve man jury slowly convinces the others that the eighteen year old on trial for the murder of his father may in fact be innocent thats got some real potential hasnt it sadly the gone in the head leftist who wrote this did what i feared he would loaded the dice and peddled a leftist agenda namely one that excuses criminals of their actions and seeks to end the death penalty thats the films overwhelming goal it wants the audience to come away from the movie not with a greater appreciation of the legal system but with the view that the death penalty should be abolished and that anyone who objects to this is a deluded little bigot lets look at the facts we are given spoilers from here on 1 an 18 year old is on trial for the murder of his father he has no alibi the alibi he gave to police that he was in a theatre the whole time fell apart when he could not recall anything about the movies that were showing even their names 2 there are two main witnesses one saw the defendant leaving the scene of the crime and heard the event the other saw the murder take place through a window and identified the defendant the defendant was also heard shouting in anger im gonna kill you the same day as the murder 3 the knife with a very rare design used in the murder is the same knife that the defendant had bought earlier and was carrying around his friends testified to this effect 4 the defendant is an habitual criminal who has had numerous run ins with the law including two arrests for knife fighting he is said to be real handy with a knife 5 the defendant has a clear motive his father was repeatedly violent and abusive towards him and had beaten him regularly with fists since he was five years of age including the day of the murder i was intrigued why does this one juror believe the defendant may not be guilty how could he convince the rest that there is reasonable doubt despite the fact i feared these questions would receive fob offs i was still hopeful an intelligent investigation would be crafted around them but no straight away the film deliberately loads the dice by having certain jurors holding prejudiced or otherwise undesirable traits while the dissenting voice is calm collected and supremely open minded thats clich u00e9 and a very common leftist tactic youll see it a lot on shows like star trek the film takes each of the facts above and finds an absurd alternate explanation for them such as the knife could have fallen out of the defendants pocket and the true murderer used an identical knife this is the fantastic explanation given by our leftist hero the film has a moronic moment where the hero pulls out a knife he has bought illegally which appears identical to the one in question the idea being that it isnt so rare after all other silly moments include the jury discussing why the defendant would come home a few hours later if he had indeed done the crime not one of them mentions that the defendant lives there and would have to come back home in order to allay fears that he was the murderer its part of an alibi what else is he going to do disappear and hope that the police dont find that a tad suspicious nearly every explanation given in favour of the defendant is absurd or complete conjecture when you string all the known facts together the chances of them all being explained away in a fashion that exonerates the defendant is literally millions to one its so implausible that no sane jury would acquit but the writer wants this to happen so it does and 12 0 in favour just in case you missed the point i love it when writers do that dont you at one point the following dialogue takes place no one can know a thing like that this isnt an exact science thats right it isnt okay then lets just forget putting people on trial because we can hardly ever be 100 sure that they did the crime in question can we the number of victims created by having no deterrent or by allowing dangerous criminals to go free is far greater than the absolute minority case where an innocent person is found guilty some people cannot be reasoned with and are far too broken to be rehabilitated they are like a dangerous dog we dont try to change the nature of a dangerous dog because we know its futile and we know that by ignoring it we are just risking more innocent lives this really isnt rocket science its just that the leftist types who have a huge stranglehold on the media tv refuse to budge and muddy the waters with their insane progressive agenda people cheering this movie are cheering for a violent thug who got away with first degree murder its not hip its just dumb wake up my rating 3 5',\n",

       " 'vertigo is a good movie by a great director viewing vertigo several times recently and reading dan auliers brilliant in depth look at the making of this movie i am at a loss to explain what i see as a vastly hyperbolic reaction to this movie by many people both in the realm of professional critics and posters on imdb this is not hitchcock at his best although i do believe it could have been true hitchcock was at his peak in this period but there are enough flaws in vertigo to bring this potential masterwork down several notches the first problem in vertigo lies with the storys failure to establish scottie ferguson we first meet scottie as he fails to make the rooftop leap and is hanging by a gutter of a building several dozen feet from the ground after this we see him making his decision to retire from police work the audience is deprived of any referent to the type of person scottie was before the incident on the rooftop this failure to establish the character and set a benchmark to measure his return by in the closing minutes of the film deprives the audience of a vital connection to any character but this problem could have easily been overcome had the third fatal flaw which i will take up soon been avoided the second problem in vertigo is a decision by hitchcock and george tomasini the editor to insert a scene shortly after scottie meets judy that reveals all of the secrets the story holds this throws away the element of suspense that might have had audiences on the edge of their seats during the final part of the movie unable to relax even at the moment of revelation for scotties character as the movie would sweep them up and hurl them through the roller coaster ride that the climax of the movie should have been but i think hitchcock and company made the decision as a direct result of an even earlier and worse mistake the third and most glaring mistake hitchcock made with vertigo was in the casting most of the cast does work ranging from passable to outstanding with one notable exception jimmy stewart in auliers account of the vertigo project he details how stewart came to star in this movie which had a lot more to do with the desires of lew wasserman agent to both stewart and hitchcock than good judgment jimmy stewart was the wrong man for this role and aulier recounts that hitchcock himself blamed stewart for vertigos dismal showing at the box office hitchcock concluded that stewart was too old for the part and refused to cast him in north by northwest because of this but i dont think stewarts age was the real hindrance here i think jimmy stewart tried to step way beyond his range as an actor and falls flat in certain key scenes mr stewart does a passable job in the first half of the movie and is quite believable as the ex detective brought low by his vertigo inducing acrophobia the first real hint of trouble comes in the last scene of the first half scottie sits in a sanitarium incommunicado and withdrawn as his stalwart friend midge tries to engage him in conversation stewarts playing of this borders on the comedic with a deer in the headlights gaze that calls to mind one of the warner brothers toons after being conked on the head rather than a man ravaged by guilt it drags the scene down so much that barbara bel geddes is left to carry it on her own and she does make a valiant attempt but her efforts are hindered by stewart from this point forward the movie enters its most crucial phase and stewarts ineffectualness grows more obvious in each successive scene in the scene where scottie tries to convince judy to change her hair color stewarts phrasing and pitch are semi comedic the lack of chemistry between the two leads brings the haunting scene of judys emergence from the bathroom to a crashing halt as stewart is unable to infuse his performance with even a modicum of passion but a few minutes later stewarts performance goes completely south as the movies climatic moments unfold scottie is righteously angry as the truth dawns on him but unfortunately stewart does not play angry well at all his maniacal and slightly feminine delivery from this point on detracts from what could have been cinematic magic at a point in the movie where scottie should have regained his senses and his sense of manhood his tone and pitch shrilly foreshadow the strident tones of mrs bates in hitchcocks next project no doubt my remarks here will be met with disdain by some of the films more ardent boosters on imdb i shall join the ranks of the great unwashed heathens who do not understand great cinema nor vertigos rightful placement at the apex of that pyramidal structure i do appreciate hitchcocks use of color as subtext in the film i am particularly fond of the color and lighting shifts in midges apartment when she allows scottie to view her painting i also appreciate and easily grasp the undertones of hitchcocks own obsessive behavior with the leading ladies of his work but wonder if that subtext was intended as dramatic irony or whether mr hitchcock was even aware of the mirror he was peering into but the brilliant touches of a master artist are not enough to make up for what this film lacks hitchcock was indeed the master and his body of work stands above a field of mostly mediocre efforts that his peers were turning out and even today not one exists who can approach his mastery but to suggest that vertigo is the cinematic equivalent of leonardos mona lisa is ludicrous and undeserved ',\n",

normandy took much longer than had been expected dwight d eisenhower the four star supreme commander of the allied expeditionary forces made up the force of some two million men massed in england for the strike at europe combined american british irish and canadian forces assault the beaches of normandy in an effort to gain a foothold on the continent from the viewpoint of the americans and germans involved the story unfolds through numerous episodes highlighting the longest day we see the commands posts occupied by the germans caen the starting point the french underground network omaha beach utah beach ste m u00e8re u00c9glise as well as sites and camps in england the film is a clear examination of d day looked at from almost every viewpoint particularly from that of the germans who are overwhelmed by the forces brought against them it is in fact field marshal erwin rommel profiled against the french beach thoroughly planted with mined obstacles who looks out to where the invasion fleet will appear later or sooner and gives the film its title the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive for the allies as well as the germans it will be the longest day in the first half much attention is focused on the weather as the troops american british irish canadian and french are poised on board their boats and ships waiting for the rain to stop in the key scene when gen eisenhower david grace makes the decision to go ahead with the invasion on june 6 more than 5 000 ships moved to assigned positions the importance of time is emphasized by increasing the ticking of a clock on the other side of the channel the german generals who know the invasion is imminent see the same nasty weather and decide to take some time off for war games french resistance fighters receive their coded instructions from bbc radio and increase their sabotage activities much of the early going is also devoted to some of the allies more unorthodox ideas the kinds of things that make more sense cinematic ally than militarily the use of metal clickers by paratroopers for identification and parachuting mechanical dummies loaded with firecrackers behind german lines to create confusion the film reaches its peak when the two sides in the battle are finally engaged the first assault wave hit the normandy beaches at 6 30 a m on june 6 the soil of france looked sordid and uninviting planning has been as complete as possible but in the vast confusion of invasion under enemy fire so many men fell uselessly when they left their landing craft and stepped into water others fell into underwater shell craters and drowned the allied air bombing that was to have knocked out german beach defense guns had not been accurate especially on omaha beach where the bombs had been laid down too far inland to do much good as a result the gunfire that met american troops there was more murderous than anything they had been prepared for today it is difficult to watch the invasion scenes and not compare them to the opening of steven spielbergs saving private ryan but that really is unfair zanuck manages to display the image of thousands of young soldiers who were killed fighting to liberate france a long aerial shot from the point of view of a german pilot josef pips priller heinz reincke strafing normandy beach reveals a shore line of successive waves of men running for their lives trying to secure omaha beach this awful waste and destruction of war scores of trucks and boats hit by shells or sunk by mines with their crew lost trucks overturned and swamped partly sunken barges and many jeeps half submerged field marshal rommel set to work to do everything possible to make the beaches if not impregnable very uninviting indeed the war will be won or lost on the beaches he states the german command was slow to react to the invasion they had been misled by the weather and the allied deception plan that normandy was a diversion and the main landing would be at pas de calais shot in cinemascope and in black and white the longest day captures the history of the moment the film tracks the book very closely shifting the viewpoints from german to french to american to british throughout in three hours zanuck and his staff expand on the scope of one day to tell mostly everything with an exceptionally strong cast playing cameo roles the cast could not be better in spite of the brevity of their roles bourvil is the french mayor of colleville who welcomes the british soldiers with a bottle of champagne irina demick is janine boitard the sexy good looking resistance member henry fonda is theodore roosevelt jr the brigadier general who limps ashore with the first of the assault boats landing on utah beach christian marquand is philippe kieffer the french commander in desperate situation in ouistreham robert mitchum is norman cota the brigadier general who chops on his cold cigar and walks along the beach and rallies his men mitchum gets some great lines and delivers them with the right amount of idealism and cynicism richard todd is john howard the major who lands by glider at b u00e9nouville to capture the canal

       " 'the first time i saw to kill a mockingbird was at a drive in theater i was probably about ten or eleven at the time even at a young age i was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that i could easily relate to perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with boo radley held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me much in the way a ghost story would im not about to make the pretense that i understood the social significance of to kill a mockingbird at the age of ten or even the greatness of the film that would come later in life after having viewed it in one of its first network television broadcasts one of the things that makes to kill a mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing harper lees novel to the screen had for the original source material it shows up on screen in every single frame each performance in this film is beyond reproach gregory peck had many fine performances over his storied career but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of atticus finch as atticus peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for jem and scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty he never talks down to them but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom yet he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice yet recognizes the failings of our justice system when called upon to do his duty he does so despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives in casting jem scout and dill producer alan j pakula and director robert mulligan faced a daunting task so much of the success of to kill a mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film for jem he chose philip alford for scout mary badham and for dill john megna alford and badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before megna was a new york native but was also inexperienced it is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess allowing them to play on the set and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings it paid off in every way imaginable none of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that i had never seen before and will unlikely witness again brock peters as tom robinson the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl also gives a performance which he would never again surpass you will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand because he dared to care about a white girl he now faces almost certain death if convicted and perhaps even if not convicted it is the first time i was able to begin to understand the effects of mans prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin just as jem and scout came of age and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred so did i equally significant is collin wilcox as mayella ewell she makes it easy for many to hate her but like atticus we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated she is a product of not only the times in which she lives but even more so of her wretched upbringing mayella is what she is but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her to mayella being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her in his screen debut as boo radley robert duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened jem dill and scout so much though on the screen for a short length of time without uttering a word duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty mistreatment and the gossip and whispers of neighbors he is a man who wants only to live in his own way yet the bond that links him to jem and scout is significant they are the childhood he had never really known just as tom robinson he has never brought harm to anyone yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist the care with which to kill a mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the art direction by henry bumstead and set decoration by oliver emert they indeed bring to life what a small southern town would have been like in the early thirties cinematographer russel harlans black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the radley house the moments when bob ewell approaches jem when he is left in a car alone and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when jem and scout are walking home from a school play elmer bernsteins score is never boisterous but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us there have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about to kill a mockingbird many of the words are far better than those that i have written then again maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that to kill a mockingbird is it will be forever remembered long after you and i have departed from this world it is at this point that

       " ' excuse me for my bad english thoughts on fellinis carrier can be divided on people who think his peak was early neorealist phase vitelloni la strada nights of cabiria do you remember the guy in the line from woody allens annie hall and on the ones that praised his fantasy phase starting with la dolce vita and followed by 8 1 2 roma etc they are both wrong both periods and its films are very important cinematically rich and skillful in directing the fact that there are many followers of both periods and equal artistic success shows that the only real difference is among their aesthetics and isnt that what makes a great director this film is considered one of the best movies of all time among critics and directors many people have complaints of how this movie is difficult to understand it is when i first saw it it was a rather very frustrating experience but once you capture it fully its amazing in fact i fully captured it after the third viewing and after that every time i see it i can find something new or different thats because this movie works differently it works out of standard movie patterns and conventions we use to see in everyday cinema above and most important of all it speaks with the different movie language and that is a real cinematic language because 8 1 2 uses specific movie instruments to transmit its content it cannot be transferred in any other form including literal thats why it is so hard to put the plot into the words and thats the major merit of this film after the tremendous commercial and artistic success in 1960 with his previous film la dolce vita fellini decided to make a film 8 1 2 about the movie director played by marcello mastroianni as guido fresh from recent success who is not sure what to film next and this egocentric director under the pressure of his producer actors friends fans and journalists is escaping into the memories of his childhood wishful fantasies and dreams at the beginning of the film theres a stunning famous dream sequence guido is trapped in a traffic jam he loses his breath while unsuccessfully trying to escape from his car people around in their vehicles are starring at him the whole scene is mute except the constant monotonous sound and from time to time it freezes suddenly he is free and flying towards sky then one of his assistants pulls him down to earth and he is awake i think its unnecessary to explain the meaning of this brilliant scene there is also a scene where he is persuaded to ask a catholic priest for an advice about the content of his next film since his films are widely released there is a moral issue but he apparently has an aversion towards church and then during a conversation with this priest guido suddenly associates his early childhood event watching a dance of a prostitute saraghina and the subsequent punishment by one priest so the current event forces its cause to come out of his subconsciousness then there is a scene u0096 quarrel between guido and his wife played by anuk aimee while sitting outdoors she is complaining about his mistress es and he is denying everything then his mistress sandra milo suddenly arrives and after she saw guido with his wife sits to one table not so close guidos wife noticed that and realized that woman is his mistress so she is continuing her quarrel with him and then comes one of the most visceral and fascinating scenes in the movie history suddenly wishful fantasy starts guidos wife stands up coming towards mistress they are kissing each other like longtime friends and making a nice conversation then guido enters his house from the childhood which is shown before with some presents in his hands and there are like 20 women around him fighting for his attention he is whipping them dominate them and there is his wife u0096 peaceful calm conservative loving so under the pressure of all around him messes he is fantasying this is psychologically known as the regression to the pleasure principle and is very common this scene is known as the harem scene and like others is followed by brilliant very suitable music score from time to time guido is fantasying a beautiful young woman claudia cardinale she is another projection of his narcissism u0096 an ideal woman to please all of his wishes not making a single complaint rosella represents symbolizes his super ego pay attention to their phone conversation also in harem scene harem is actually his id fulfilling all his infantile fantasies she is above him making complaints his producer is paternal figure all his fathers wishes demands to guido are now reactivated with producer pay attention to very interesting first fantasy scene in the movie on the grave father asks a man something like how is my boy doing and the man makes face like well later we discover that the man is his producer guidos wife and his mother the same thing and we discover this in the same scene when his mother turns into his wife critical writer may represent his raw intellect but also artistic vanity while conocchia is his neglected emotional aspect at the end of the movie he eventually becomes aware of the causes of his confusion and self deceptions this sudden awareness is symbolized by shooting himself shooting his confusion that is and having a final monologue accept me as i am only then can we discover each other

       " 'a glorious film just a few things to add to what everyone else has said nb spoilers towards the bottom of the page not that the plot is exactly a suspense its a realistic story on the face of it the whole thing is reminiscent of the verismo italian operas from the end of the 19th century like cavalleria rusticana where soap opera plots about ordinary people are set to emotionally stunning over the top drama queen music inherently a democratic kind of style saying that shopworkers and little old ladies have as much right to passion and glory as kings or gangsters or movie stars yes the singing is silly but the film knows this in the very first scene the men in the washroom joke about carmen another example of the same style and one of them sings something like im going to see a film i dont like opera i cant stand all the singing its a film that knows mechanics dont usually sing arias while they check the oil and makes a joke about it buffy fans will have got the same point from once more with feeling the fundamental problem of the musical is why is everybody singing but there is something unrealistic about it the beauty everyone and everything is good looking the people are beautiful the dirty old town is beautiful cheap bars are beautiful squalid damp flats are beautiful abandoned hulk ships are beautiful a garage forecourt with petrol pumps and a canopy is beautiful all the men are good looking and as for the women someone asked why more men than women like this weepy film the obvious answer is catherine deneuve but anne vernon playing her mother is cuter than anyone her age has a right to be and as for ellen farner guy has not one but two stupendously attractive women after him which is about 1 99 more than the average member of the audience the costumes match the background far too often for it to be anything but deliberate at first its even more confusing than the singing madame emery dresses differently to match the wallpaper of the shop and her flat sometimes her clothes even seem to change colour for no reason other than to match the scenery genevieve stands in front of a window while a truck thats exactly the same shade as her cardigan pulls up behind her when she tries on her maternity dress it has the same combination of royal blue background and pink flowers as the wallpaper behind her when she walks past the docks with roland they are both wearing different shades of off white hers matches the rusting paint on the old ships his matches the cliffs visible in the distance when guy and madeleine sit next to each other outside the cafe her orange brown clothes and even her lipstick match the door behind her while his dark brown jacket matches not only the wood behind him but also her hair exactly the same trick weve seen when he was sitting next to the prostitute jenny with her red dress on front of the red screen inside the other bar we are in fantasy land here even if it looks a little like cherbourg but this is all the same as the singing to ask how does a poor family afford such clothes or why is the delivery van exactly that shade of yellow is to miss the point as much as to ask why does a shopkeeper sing to his customers or why does it always rain when we say goodbye in this movie in this fantasy land the world is turned upside down the meek can inherit the earth or at least look as if they might small town cherbourg is as romantic as paris sailors and truck drivers sing while they work the poor wear clothes that money cant buy the scenery changes colour to match your wardrobe every man looks like a leading man and every shop girl truly is as beautiful as any duchess this is singing in the rain set in the backroom of a shop instead of the back lot of a hollywood studio this is west side story without the violence this is a small town moulin rouge this is brief encounter on acid its not a tragic ending any more than the endings of casablanca or brief encounter are tragic its the right ending were not so much sad for genevieve even though we are crying as we are happy for roland who deserves a break even though we know hes probably a crook if we are crying its because guy needs to hug francoise we expect that the marriages will work out in the end maybe they have worked out already if these people are not going to be happy its not because they married the wrong partners and what other film has had hundreds of thousands of viewers in floods of tears watching an aerial shot of an esso service station ',\n",

       " 'when i was a little kid i watched battle of the bulge approximately 58 million times i thought it was the cats pajamas but even back then my young and usually trusting mind could detect a strong whiff of baloney from this movie i had difficultly believing for example that every allied soldier in world war ii was an incompetent nitwit except for the all knowing all seeing henry fonda throughout the course of this movie fondas character predicts the battle rather like a psychic or someone with access to the script uncovers every weakness in the german plan and then finally plays a key role in stopping the entire german offensive what a versatile guy huh and yes even my inexperienced child self found it rather weird that in this movie the americans are depicted as being utterly incapable of fighting the germans the film suggests in a somewhat insulting fashion that in point of fact the americans did not win this battle in the traditional way we only won it because the germans ran out of gasoline and decided to walk home what complete rubbish anybody with even a vague understanding of the real battle knows that the americans won simply by counterattacking what a novel idea some commentators on this site have argued that the films historical inaccuracies dont matter and that only world war ii nerds will be offended by the scripts tinkering with history however i would argue that battle of the bulge is so inaccurate that such a defense doesnt hold water and its not as though the inaccuracies make the film better in fact im confident that a more realistic portrayal of the battle would have made the film far more exciting even handed and worthwhile and yet and yet i still like this stupid movie the tank battles are fun the music is great and the cast is really top notch heres a general rule of thumb that i apply to the film as a whole the scenes with the americans are stupid and the scenes with the germans are good for example robert shaw is simply awesome as the fictional german commander he has a fascinating series of moral debates on the nature of the war with his aide a long suffering corporal played by hans christian blech these scenes are a real highlight of the film and their intelligence makes for a stark contrast with the general idiocy of other scenes theres also a very good scene when charles bronson tells fonda that his men are so angry because of the war that they want to completely annihilate germany and its people this somewhat sinister note always gets my attention but it pretty much amounts to nothing perhaps the best thing that i can say about this movie is that it got me curious about the real battle and the war in general because its reasonably cool and exciting the film is a pretty good vehicle for generating interest in the events it depicts so carelessly also the script is perhaps not quite so inaccurate as some people claim the early forest battles are somewhat like the real thing and the general nature and goals of the german offensive are accurately portrayed its just that too many dumb hollywood moments spoil the movie for any serious aficionado of history and or cinema thats a shame really i wouldnt mind seeing a more accurate remake which presumably would not involve an omnipotent henry fonda singlehandedly foiling the last great german offensive of world war ii ',\n",

       " 'this is one of the most hauntingly beautiful timeless epic romances of all time set against the backdrop of the russian revolution stunning cinematography combines here with a turbulent historical setting an unforgettable idealistic hero and one of the most compelling fictional love triangles of all time this surely ranks among the best of director david leans many masterpieces it is based on boris pasternaks novel which i confess to not having read so cannot comment on the faithfulness of the film the story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet yuri zhivago and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the russian revolution the story is told in flashback mode during later communist years by yuris half brother yevgraf a soviet army officer to the young woman tanya who may be the long lost daughter of yuri and his lover lara as a sensitive young boy yuris mother dies and he is adopted by a foster family the gromekos later reaching adulthood he studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart tonya and they have a little boy sasha however earlier at their engagement party he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful amp mysterious woman named lara soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by world war i and the bolshevik revolution the handsome omar sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of zhivago masterfully conveying his characters emotions who can forget his intensely expressive tear filled eyes at some of the more emotional moments especially with snowflakes melting on them a physician but also a poet yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty around him his gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the horrific violence of war and revolution as yuri witnesses such atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism also this is a man who remains very much an individual despite the bolsheviks philosophies of collectivism that eras devastating events unfold including the bolshevik revolution and subsequent civil war between the tsarist whites amp the communist reds however the main conflict here is internal within yuris own heart as he is torn between fidelity and passion he deeply loves his sweet gentle and dependable wife tonya and struggles to remain faithful yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the alluring lara a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are caring for wounded soldiers lara serves as his muse speaks to his soul and is the inspiration for his poetry unlike most modern cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt yuri and lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are repeatedly brought together and separated by the upheaval of war and revolution surely if yuri is the worst of sinners then he is the worst of sufferers also the two women in yuris life wife and mistress stand in sharp contrast though both come across as sympathetic characters the lovely geraldine chaplain portrays his ladylike aristocratic wife tonya who is well bred and has been schooled abroad the daughter of the bourgeois gromeko she is actually yuris step sister which might understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings from her husband yuri and lara succumb to their passions even as the blameless tonya is pregnant with yuris second child tonya is a warm loving wife and devoted mother undeserving of her husbands infidelity julie christie plays the gorgeous amp enigmatic lara a woman whose station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men yet she possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength as a teenage girl she is seduced and violated by the lecherous victor komarovsky a despicable politician and her own mothers lover she falls under repeated abuse by this vile amp contemptible character who calls lara a slut and treats her as such later she is fianc u00e9 amp then wife to the misguided idealist and activist pasha who holds intense political ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him pasha later becomes strelnikov the obsessive bolshevik officer who eventually comes into confrontation with zhivago during much of the tumult lara entrusts her own amp pashas daughter katya into the care of others of course the legend of lara lives on musically in maurice jarres lovely haunting laras theme supporting cast members include rod steiger who is perfect as the villainous komarovsky and tom courtenay as pasha strelnikov a shy and pure individual who earns the abused laras respect and love later going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary alec guiness portrays yuris half brother yevgraf and ralph richardson is tonyas aristocratic amp gentlemanly father alexander gromeko this film has amazing oscar winning cinematography throughout during world war i and the revolution there are vivid scenes of battle mass desertion and endless march through the desolate blizzard ridden siberian wasteland also visually stunning is the spectacular train ride yuri and his family must make from moscow to the urals site of the family dachau however surely most viewers truly unforgettable pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle at varykino no other film can compare in its depiction of winter scenery this sweeping panorama the eras tumultuous political events and the emotional portrait of one sensitive mans experience of them create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga ',\n",

       " 'it took me almost 40 years to finally see a patch of blue it was promoted as the kind of trendy raise your social consciousness movie that i avoid like the plague the mid sixties was full of this kind of moralizing political stuff as the country finally began to wake up to the embarrassing social inequities and the hypocrisy that hung over everything like a cloud of poison gas the older half of the baby boomer generation was beginning to question the fear and hate of their parents and hollywood was beginning to discover that this had exploitation potential most of these things were moronic at the time and have not improved with age ironically what led to my finally viewing this film was watching catherine deneuve in another film from 1965 polanskis repulsion writing a review of that film i lamented the failure of the academy to nominate deneuve for best actress and polanski for best director whatever was thought then about the films and performances actually nominated in retrospect they pale in comparison to repulsion no one even gives a thought anymore to darling or ship of fools doctor zhivago is more big that it is good and julie andrews was great in a very weak movie but decent musical while a thousand clowns and the collector with samantha eggar are good cult films they are easy to dismiss but when i got to elizabeth hartmans nomination for a patch of blue i realized that i knew very little about her or the performance having dismissed it as just a reprise of patty dukes performance in the miracle worker i became more intrigued when i discovered that hartman was the actress who blew me away in the beguiled so i picked up a copy of the 2 35x1 aspect ratio dvd of patch of blue i was surprised to find that a film with the name of a color in its title had been shot in black and white and for anyone thinking about getting this dvd it was transferred to dvd from one of the cleanest prints or maybe from the original mgm negative i have ever seen the detail and contrasts are as good as they must have been when it was first printed 40 years ago after seeing patch of blue i still made my case for repulsion but qualified it by saying only hartmans performance was in the same class as that of deneuve which was quite a concession for me but both performances are truly wonderful as for patch of blue i found it absolutely amazing close to perfection there were so many places where guy green could have screwed it up and he neatly avoided them all the director is presented with a real problem when deciding how to film an actor playing a blind person tight shots on the eyes are what makes acting for the camera so special unfortunately the unfocused eyes of a blind person cannot convey much emotion in fact anything but a blank stare betrays the blind illusion so guy green had to get a verbal and body language performance out hartman that compensated for not being able to use tight shots and hartman had to work at not just playing a complex character but also at maintaining the illusion that she was blind all her scenes are excellent but she has three that are especially memorable the first is at the kitchen table where she casually discusses being raped with gordon her matter of fact narration plays perfectly with poitiers horrified reaction which of course she cant see the second is after a stranger has helped her back to the apartment from her terrifying failed attempt to find the park by herself in a few minutes she ranges from despair so deep it verges on madness to extreme gratitude toward the boy who brings her a message to giddy joy at the realization that gordon cares enough about her to send someone to see what has happened to her hartman plays all parts of the scene convincingly i wonder if they shot it all the same day or if green shot each sequence separately the third scene and my personal favorite is when she is alone in the park and it starts to rain if someone told me of the challenges posed by this scene i would not have given it much chance of success yet green pulls it off and hartman is absolutely believable the is the scene where you first really connect to selenas fear and isolation because by this time you know and identify with the character absolutely amazing here is a little elizabeth hartman trivia after patty duke turned down the role because of type casting concerns and hayley mills for financial reasons what a disaster that would have been they tested 150 unknowns and choose the 22 year old hartman i believe i was lacking the things they wanted an actress to lack hartman told sidney skolsky when he made her the subject of one of his tintypes profiles after meeting her slolsky said she is shy timid she sleeps in a normal size bed in sleeveless nightgowns she always takes her raggedy ann doll to bed with her prior to oscar night hartman who still lived in youngstown with her mother commented im just waiting for someone to offer me a part in a picture or a play im climbing the walls as a matter of fact mgm did not use her picture in their oscar ads for her but used a sight gag a pair of sunglasses in a price waterhouse envelope ',\n",

       " 'to see how beautiful moving exciting and astonishing melvilles le samourai is to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made arguably the most perfect it is necessary to forget everything youve been told about it if youve been told nothing than you are very lucky the first time i saw i knew nothing either and it was a revelation i came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes cinema can do that i absorbed every melville film i could find they are very hard to get and read every article or book about him my love grew to uncontrollable passion but a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work and this sublime miracle especially the most obvious is the directors obsession with american cinema that his films are mere tributes to american cinema or stern deconstructions of them it is true that jef costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby but so do at least 400 men in paris and it is true that melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster but most importantly of masculinity and its power elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here the idea that jef begins the film whole looking at the mirror during the course of the narrative he loses this self sufficient image cracking up as it fragments split by mirrors trapped behind bars although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies some see jef as an example of existentialist man a man who does not exist except through his acts the film patiently records endless scenes of jef walking staring preparing for his jobs etc his final ritual is a preparation for his death as existentialism suggests friends social purpose etc fall away and one is left alone with ones fate or as an expression of fatalistic orientalist ethics the film is called le samourai concerning solitude and the inevitability of death melville himself offered two possible interpretations as a study in schizophrenia and as an allegory of man jef pursued by destiny the inspector into the arms of death valerie the pianist all of these of course are valid interpretations i am more sympathetic to those who see samourai as a dream a study in solitude or a portrait of mental breakdown the films action takes place largely at night there is a frequently oneiric tone to melvilles style the endless walking the silence the deliberate paring down of the mise en scene to near monochrome jefs impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist walking mechanically down countless corridors as in a dream whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way we keep returning to the same few locales the film opens with jef lying smoking in bed in the dark one powerful scene is jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm has he had a nightmare or is it the sound of a passing truck samourai is also much more moving as a story of solitude than antonionis entire oeuvre put together the only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is jefs loneliness living with his only friend a caged bullfinch usually a symbol of female entrapment in a dismally run down sparse grey bedsit prey to any intruders although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police he is safer on the margins in anonymous streets abandoned railway yards disused buildings or at least he was before all the trouble started he is defined against the grim geometric anonymity of modern life his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in the elevator shafts that imprison him he is the image of man in a surveillance society an innocent man until proven guilty having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat many people see melvilles films as sublimated allegories of france under the occupation his only contact with people is in the preparation of death his is a sterile self negating existence ascetic as a monk his uniform as ritual vestments that jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted there are two heartbreaking moments in this cool austere film when emotion breaks alain delons astonishing performance the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in la jetee when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught helpless a child looking for a mother to reassure him this is the key to the film i believe jef the lonely wanderer searching for home the second after the celebrated metro chase in the stolen car his face for a moment betraying hear beating terror at these moments allegories and theories simply break down jefs mental breakdown is of course linked to all this over the credits jef smokes alone in his bedroom barely visible the two bright windows look like eyes as in becketts end game a figure for the mind a mind at the end of its tether as seen by melvilles horizontal use of hitchcocks famous vertigo shot contracting and constricting the room to breaking point revealing the instability of this safe haven and jefs image of himself mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ when jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract his accomplice lit by a lamp looks like a terrifying spirit jef is a trapped character in his room identity plot by the police and the gangsters by geography shadows corridors by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point he is in hell the only way out is self extinction it is important not to see melville as child of sartre which limits him but of nabokov whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work it is vitally important not to take him at face value jefs shooting of rey impossible magical is pure nabokov i could go on the benjaminian idea of the flaneur and paris the extraordinary near futuristic sets the comedy e g see who jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description its remarkable analysis of the gaze the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics the running motif of the theatre performing acting in both senses jefs costume the line up in a theatre like space the closing show is over drum roll everything about this film as john woo noted is perfect but there is one sequence breaking with melvilles calm distant style throughout that i would list on my ten best ever as jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun firstly he faces the audience we could be no closer then just as the struggle begins melville cuts away his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills following jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailants car it is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known ive just watched it twice in two days i really must watch it again ',\n",

       " 'a stand alone monument in cinema history stanley kubricks magnum opus 2001 a space odyssey 1968 is an undeniable masterpiece 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions but gave cinema a whole new meaning from the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution 2001 isnt concerned with entertaining us but rather to inspire us with awe ive never seen a person say 2001 a space odyssey i dont think ive seen it oh wait the one with like the spaceships and stuff while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll what viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you get it or not nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects but as kubrick said is intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness in it of itself exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one thats sheer genius at its highest form at its premiere 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike walkouts numbered well over 200 including rock hudson who asked will someone tell me what the hell this is all about the new york times remarked somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring superb photography major asset to confusing long unfolding plot newsday commented renowned critic pauline kael even went as far as calling 2001 trash masquerading as art its understandable though in a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra terrestrial life was everyday talk audiences came into 2001 expecting answers when will we reach the moon what does the future hold are we alone to their great surprise 2001 did the paradoxical leaving more questions to answer than answered questions even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism kubrick saw ahead highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith the apes approach it with dignity respect and mindfulness the humans approach it with arrogance grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture since the monolith represents the incomprehensible man with his limited senses cannot comprehend the absence perfect black of color or light kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty emphasized in the clavius base briefing scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public for if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning as stated by dr heywood floyd william sylvester it may cause cultural shock and social disorientation its a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically yet apes are not much better theyre not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes and with the discovery of bones as weapons kill their own race for a puddle of water possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence because like our ancestors at heart mankind has been and will always be selfish far before the terminator 1984 or the matrix 1999 accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence there was 2001 h a l 9000 voice played by douglas rain was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history theres something about his calm voice unpredictability and especially his omniscient single red eye thats so frightening kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans irony neither dave bowman keir dullea or frank poole gary lockwood display much emotion throughout the film while h a l albeit a machine exhibits some while pleading for life singing daisy which by the way is a heart wrenching scene and murdering his crew members there are clear connotations of humanitys fate when h a l attempts to kill frank dave and the hibernating crew members yet h a l contrast to what he may think is not perfect if he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit he wouldnt have gotten himself killed kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race but if we are not careful they soon will this idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution after the famous star gate sequence dave is enlightened in a room the setting hints at the enlightenment era exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground establishing a heavenly environment the eerie silence is ominous magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene as dave exits his eva pod he watches himself age rapidly through one point perspective he knocks over a wine glass while eating suggesting that man no matter how advanced will keep making mistakes as he lays on his deathbed later he reaches out to the monolith alluding to adam reaching out to god in michelangelos the creation of adam after man is enlightened he inevitably dies a pessimistic ending no man is then transported back to earth as a space baby an infinitely more advanced race marking a new age of evolution a masterful stroke of genius kubrick ends hopeful giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes or is it hopeful is he implying that civilization is evolving badly or is he suggesting that civilization will never evolve there are multiple interpretations of the ending and its a question for you to answer there is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001s composition throughout the film possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe the painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony practically forcing you to admire its artistry while andrei tarkovskys work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty kubricks artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness each shot averaging 13 6 seconds possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema but of course its impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect the visual effects are so unanimously praised that its hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were hopeless i can talk for days about the impeccable zero gravity effects clever rotating sets fastidiously constructed spaceships the brilliant use of slit scan photography for the psychedelic star gate sequence or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting but whats the point you dont need me to appreciate 2001s immaculate visuals finally the choice of music is outstanding originally alex north was appointed to score the film but kubrick turned it down in post production critic roger ebert explains it perfectly norths rejected score which is available on a recording is a good job of film composition but would have been wrong for 2001 because like all scores it attempts to underline the action to give us emotional cues the classical music chosen by kubrick exists outside the action it uplifts it wants to be sublime it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals but why all the slow parts asks the one who fell asleep primarily to establish tone unlike the low budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it 2001 was meant to be taken seriously it symbolizes a quest for whether god exists or not challenges humanitys fate and questions evolution as a whole if each shots average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between the whole film wouldve been a mess space isnt fast paced like we see in most movies space is slow really really slow the addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time thankfully its ingenuity was gradually recognized and its now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time it stands at an impressive 6 on the bfi sight and sound critics poll in 2012 ties for 2nd in the directors poll places 15th on afis 100 years 100 movies and tops the online film critics society list of greatest science fiction films of all time 2001 a space odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking the first half drags the dialogue is unnatural the static camera creates no visual interest there are barely any emotional punches characters are monotonous and none of the protagonists if there even are have dimensionality arcs or epiphanies nonetheless its transcendental and sublime awe inspiring and thought provoking visually revolutionary technically impeccable

       " '1968s planet of the apes has been my favorite film since i first saw it in april of that year when i was eight years old the movie had a huge impact back then and i cannot emphasize more the power to grip the imagination it had and has and the shock the final image of the movie was back then i literally left the theatre stunned and speechless no other movie of my youth had such impact or created such suspension of disbelief over the past thirty four years planet of the apes has attained classic status and its a tribute to the films excellence that there are so many comments left here on the internet movie database that this film is better than the viewer thought it would be or that it wasnt campy or cheesy as theyd always thought or that it was more intelligent and thought provoking than most films theyve ever seen and that despite the studio stupidly putting the final shot one of the most famous last shots in the history of american cinema on the cover of the video they were still stunned and haunted by it planet of the apes is based on a 1963 french novel la planete des singes by pierre boulle most famous as the author of la pont de la riviere kwai 1952 which became the 1957 film the bridge on the river kwai the story tells of a french journalist ulysse merou who in the year 2500 travels with two companions in a near light speed spacecraft to the red giant star betelgeuse in the constellation of orion there they find a sister planet to earth soror and after landing on a remote plateau discover a race of human beings that are no more than animals naked and unable to speak the three earthmen are stripped of there clothes by the humans who hate anything that isnt natural their spacecraft is destroyed by the savage people and they are run off into the jungle the next morning the tribe of wild humans are attacked by hunters who are gorillas dressed like men hunting like men and acting and speaking like men one of the earthmen is killed another disappears and merou is captured taken to a research lab and subjected to scientific experiments a sympathetic female animal psychologist dr zira a chimpanzee is intrigued by merou keenness and soon learns that this man is highly intelligent and able to learn speech with her help merou learns all about the simian civilization on soror in which the apes live in modern cities drive cars fly planes and watch tv and where conservative orangutans especially one named zaius so fear this intelligent human being that they seek to have him destroyed with the help of ziras fiance an archeologist named cornelius merou unwittingly discovers a secret about the origins of intelligent life on soror thats so dangerous hes forced to flee the planet of the apes and return to earth boulles novel is a satire in the tradition of voltaire that mocks humankinds anthropocentric theory of the universe from which human beings derive their sense of importance and is laced with the kind of harrowing ironies that boulle was famous for the movie based on this book is an americanized adaptation of it rod serling did the first drafts of the screenplay simplifying the plot by fitting it into the mold of his twilight zone tv series and introducing an anti nuclear war theme not present in the boulle novel because of budget constraints the modern ape civilization had to be reduced to a less technological one something more reminiscent of ancient greece in fact after michael wilson who had also adapted boulles bridge over the river kwai to the screen was brought in to do the final script drafts what emerged was a political allegory more akin to an aesop fable than a voltairian satire an improvement on the book was to turn the merou character now named taylor into a misanthrope and to reduce the scope of the story into a kind of misanthropes comeuppance charlton heston was a perfect choice to play the unlikable american astronaut having essayed such similar bastard roles in 1954s the naked jungle 1963s diamond head and 1963s 55 days at peking and the movie would be a lot less funny and pointed without him roddy mcdowall and kim hunter as cornelius and zira and maurice evans as dr zaius

in this arthur p jacobs production for 20th century fox is the veteran cinematographer leon shamroys panavision lensing which makes great use of remote areas of southern utah around lake powell to suggest an alien world and jerry goldsmiths avant garde musical score which has become a landmark cannot be emphasized more for contributing to the weird atmosphere and eerie mood of the movie rarely has a movie score so fit like hand in glove than this one planet of the apes was a box office smash in 1968 but if ever there was a movie that was more a victim of its own success its this one four sequels two tv series numerous novelizations and comic book adventures and a lamentable remake in 2001 have been spawned by its popularity most of which has been so inferior in quality to have

ever been so convincing in such a powerful and colorful character only peter 0tooles eccentric t e lawrence comes immediately to mind both he and scott create their characters out of complementary contradictions lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it patton cannot separate the conduct of war from his own personal glorification and both actors are given large canvases upon which to work screenwriters francis ford coppola and edmund h north and director franklin j schaffner introduce a 16th century warrior lost in contemporary times he is a brilliant and military historian with a hazardous speech magnificently uniformed and wearing his ivory handled pistol george s patton steps up against a backdrop of the stars and stripes before an unseen gathering of soldiers defining himself in unambiguous terms as a man who revels in war the scene is cut to a close shot of two scorpions crawling across the body of a dead soldier at the kasserine pass tunisia the camera then pulls back to reveal a harsh look at american casualties with dozens of arabs busily stripping more bodies the american army has just suffered its first defeat at the hands of the germans pattons first job is to restore the morale and discipline of the dispirited troops of his new command his experience with tanks led general dwight eisenhower to place him in charge of one of the three task forces invading north africa in 1943 according to his theory of war patton would drive all the way to palermo on the northern coast of sicily slicing the island in half but his finest moment comes during the massive german counteroffensive in the ardennes by the time the germans feared him above all other allied generals schaffner turns to the germans for comments on pattons abilities they expect him to lead a major invasion when he was sent to corsica the germans were convinced he would lead an invasion of southern france when he was sent to cairo they feared for an invasion through the balkans patton is seen reprimanded by gen dwight d eisenhower for indiscreet political statements as an able tactician who promotes himself to three star general before its officially approved by the u s senate patton proves himself as the most effective american field commander of the european war behind his audacity lay an imaginative planning and a shrewd judgment patton knows that loyalty to a leader would inspire his men to take on objectives against all odds his strict discipline toughness and disregard of classic military rules contributed to his advance across france and germany the modest and conscientious omar bradley commander of the u s 12th army group who had served under patton in africa and sicily as a deputy commander found patton to be a superb combat general but hotheaded profane and unpredictable bradley ends now as pattons superior it was soon apparent that the two make a superb team pattons dash and drive in the field is a perfect complement to bradleys careful planning with the help of bradley patton prepares to re engage german field marshal erwin rommel after he defeats rommels 10th panzer division at el guettar thanks to his analysis of rommels published strategies he shouts one of the greatest lines in war films rommel you magnificent bastard i read your book at the same time his rivalry with his field marshal montgomery hero of el alamein becomes more intense patton was motivated by a pride to reach his target before his british colleague sometimes not for the purpose of the allies karl malden has the films only other significant leading role as the most capable yet unpretentious general malden could be deduced from the number of major directors with whom he has worked these include cukor hathaway kazan king preminger milestone vidor hitchcock brooks mulligan daves brando frankenheimer ford quine and schaffner in his best and most personal work he has succeeded in exploring depths of moral ambiguity rare in commercial cinema schaffner illuminates various sides of pattons remarkable personality presenting a dashing extrovert and attractive general with a compassionate side touring an evacuation hospital in sicily patton slaps an enlisted soldier twice calling him a yellow and threatens to shoot him before two men forcibly remove him from the tent the incident occurs because pattons views of bravery and cowardice are so severely limited the fighting general who has the imagination to write poetry and to believe that he has been reincarnated in ancient greece at carthage and moscow cannot conceive of a psychological wound that he cannot see the incident occurred after he prays at the bedside of one man severely injured patton whispers some words in his ear which the audience doesnt hear then lays a medal on his pillow and gives him a gentle touch on his head the portrait is so compelling that its easy to overlook pattons own final words in the film all glory is fleeting franklin j schaffners motion picture reveals an effective portrait of three men patton bradley and the unseen dwight eisenhower the film is a fine epic about a pure warrior and a magnificent anachronism who

camera agutter provides a skilful performance as a prejudiced unworldly teenager who is naively unaware of the sexuality she exudes whether naked or wearing her high cut school skirt although it was a somewhat amusing shock to recently discover that a body double was employed for agutter in the shower scenes for an american werewolf in london no such deceit was used in this film immediately after

killing of animals and the domestic butchering of joints of meat to give a stark contrast between nature and civilisation however given this was his first solo effort his overworked montages can be a little irritating and confusing and show off the cinematographer rather than the director in roeg the director emphasises the unrealised sexual tension by explicitly marrying shots of both the teenagers with suggestive trees in the form of intertwined human limbs as well as providing us with a diverting interlude involving a group of meteorologists the deeply sad misunderstanding of the two cultures gives poignancy to the film that is its strength especially delineated by the aborigines tribal courtship dance for agutter which only serves to terrify her and increase her distrust her lack of emotion for their former helpmate is staggering when faced with a dangling corpse the girl asks trivial questions of her brother about his breakfast whilst pointlessly picking ants off the body the tragic outcome is also indicative of the current state of aboriginal life expectancy with a higher proportion dying through accident assault and self harm than any other australian demographic group the failure of her parents to prepare her for the change from childhood may have contributed to the tragedy and it is only on reflection years later living the same life as her parents and similarly caged in an apartment block that agutters character senses that maybe she missed her chance it is interesting to note that the children are deliberately english to highlight the cultural clash between the european settlers and the original inhabitants of this ancient land and i wonder if similarly white australians would have had any more understanding of the indigenous customs of the aborigine boy

       " 'the godfather is one of the few films in which i personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings from the direction to the acting to the storyline to the score the godfather has the word classic written all over and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques the godfather has not been as revolutionary as citizen kane but its influence on motion pictures is comparable rarely a movie has defined or re defined a genre as much as this one did for gangster movies but its influence goes well beyond that the godfathers influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every organized crime film nowadays almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in the godfather the italian american old mobster a la don vito corleone has become one of the most established figures in the publics imagination but to say that the godfather is simply influential is to diminish its true qualities and so is to describe it simply as a movie about gangsters the mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around despite the fact that the word is never mentioned but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked considerations on how the social environments changes us on how moral values appear different from different point of views on how violence can destroy a human soul and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability as good as the direction and the story are it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors performances had in the cinematic triumph that was the godfather praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an american movie all the cast in the godfather succeeds in portraying complex three dimensional characters without ever making a slip the exceptional portrayals of don vito and michael corleone respectively by marlon brando and al pacino the performances by robert duvall james caan and diane keaton as tom hagen santino corleone and kay adams the ruthless virgil sollozzo played by al lettieri as well as more than a few other roles are all perfect for the movie and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people not just actors we are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him although michael corleone is the character that gets the most screen time everybody is the center of this world his own way the movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple storyline movies that came out in the last few years the movie opens on the wedding of don vito corleones daughter connie talia shire don corleone is a powerful man and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life the wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the dons power extends from the regular worker in a neighborhood to the immensely popular singer to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer don corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back some are trustworthy some are not but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the don can almost always distinguish the two however this is 1946 times are changing and to many of the younger people working in the crime business don corleones ideas are becoming obsolete the don believes that the new trend in the business narcotics is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self destroying while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time part of the government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye drugs are another thing to this day don corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name sollozzo enters the picture the refusal of don corleone to cooperate with sollozzo and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter will ignite a war that will cost many lives and that will see michael corleone vitos younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business lose his innocence and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against i purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because i believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance and believe it or not there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie there are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension various twists and although like any other masterpiece the godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience i believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes besides to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible there has been much speculation on how the events in the godfather novel written by mario puzo the book the film is based on could be an expos u00e9 of true facts many believe that the character of johnny fontane for instance was based on frank sinatras real life and many of the other characters were modeled after real people i wont go into that frankly i have no idea whether these voices are reliable although the frank sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable the cinematography of the godfather is dark and tasteful and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in there is a fair amount of violence though rarely gratuitous the godfather certainly doesnt need my recommendation the film is universally considered one of the best of all time and the performances by pacino and brando alone is the stuff of legends ',\n",

       " ' the godfather simply put is one of the greatest films of all time the script is thee best ive ever read the direction is flawless the acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie ive ever seen or will ever see its also one of the most precise and intricate films ive ever come across as writer mario puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film watching the godfather is like watching cinematic art francis ford coppolas direction is what brings this film thats so ambitious and so grand down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care the film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker as the man starts talking about honor family respect and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness he begs for justice since the american system has failed him he goes to don corleone marlon brando for justice don vito is the man of power hes the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight untouchable or so we think some of the greatest moments in the film and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between michael and vito are of vito crying over his son sonnys james caan death when michael learns of the news he has little reaction two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have and they come from brando as vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down there is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting but compared the film opens during the wedding of don vito daughter connie talia shire and we see just how strong the bond of family really is you have the family dancing with each other drinking laughing and sitting next to each other to show how close they are then we see some of the outsiders such as the barzini family and surprisingly michael al pacino along with his girlfriend kay diane keaton on the outskirts without much interaction michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and tom hagen robert duvall is more apart of the family than he is his opening words are to kay and they include thats my family kay thats not me we get the feeling that michaels nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name this is what makes al pacino role significantly the hardest performance in the entire film to portray hes the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the familys actions and businesses to by films end head of the family brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for but michael is too cold for that never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable and in lesser hands it very easily could have been the final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating as the film draws to an end michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions hes treated not with respect but as an outsider too high ranking for his experience the corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything yet we never get that feeling we see the two leaders confidence and we keep our confidence in them even if the other family members doubt their decisions michael goes to las vegas and makes moe greene an offer he cant refuse then he refuses this is pacino shinning moment in the film theres no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name after he treats moe greene like utter garbage fredo john cazale gets upset and starts barking at him coppola is perfectly on his game here too as we watch from fredos height looking down on michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes that have so much going on behind them and simply says fredo dont ever take sides with anyone against family again ever thats some serious foreshadowing for the second film and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what pacino and coppola pulled off in this scene cazale too we have no idea how serious michael is these are some of the stepping stones that make michaels change believable hes not quite his father vito has a soft spot for his children admittedly so as hes capable of turning on anyone and using the line its strictly business when it comes to family issues michaels sister connie calls him a cold hearted bastard at the end of the film its hard to find better superlatives than that yet we still love him the interesting thing about pacino performance is that he doesnt sugarcoat it he doesnt try to make the audience love him he plays the character as the character should be played thats the sign of great writing great acting and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable this crew just presents the character with all his flaws and lets us decide if we love him or hate him its films like the godfather that made me wish i had amnesia so i could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again ',\n",

       " 'occasionally during the 1950s and 1960s i and friends interested in literature and the arts would discuss a book written anonymously in 1954 by a woman author using the name pauline reage and commonly regarded as a very powerful work depicting submission as the route to a womans fulfillment this discussion was however largely based on hearsay the book itself was not readily available in the u k where i was then living we understood that a copy was available in the british museum reading room for anyone who called themselves a scholar but it was not regarded as suitable reading matter for ordinary folk and no british publisher dared to publish it when i eventually saw it on sale i was sufficiently intrigued to purchase a copy and i quickly appreciated that the very deadpan and unemotional style of writing gave this work an extraordinary power which made it difficult to forget unlike most books it was very hard to understand the authors motive in writing it but the scenes of pain and humiliation it featured were so lucid that i assumed it would never be possible for this book to be filmed i was therefore quite surprised when just jaeckins film was released in france in 1975 many years passed before this film was cleared by british censors for distribution in the u k and by then i was living in north america where i have seen it both in the cinema and on the first choice television channel the film features almost everything described in the book with remarkable accuracy but it is depicted in such an unemotional and almost documentary manner that it is remarkably non pornographic spoiler ahead right through history the wish to own and dominate women has been part of the masculine character and this is brought out clearly in the literature of every age however literature has not always made it equally clear that there is just as frequent a wish on the part of many women to be totally submissive such a woman often believes that however unreasonable the demands made on her by her dominant man this behaviour will ultimately force him to truly love her artistically it is important to note that nothing which happens to o in this film takes place before she is asked for and has given her consent voluntary but total and completely passive submission is the theme of the film there is one scene in the film which i found particularly effective this is the commanders ball just before the end which o attends naked except for a fabulous mask that makes her appear completely anonymous sir stephen gives o the chance to choose the mask she will wear and she chooses one which is strongly suggestive of a bird of prey the symbolism of this appears to be that by their very submissiveness these women are also preying on their men who become deprived of any opportunity to form any normal relationship with them and may thereby be psychologically damaged almost as badly as their victims tonly right at the end of the film does any emotion break through when sir stephen indicates to o that her prolonged submission to pain and humiliation have won his love and she responds by demonstrating the affection she feels for him for the first time when this film was first shown in paris it ran for thirteen years and i found it intriguing to read that more than half of most audiences were women clearly even in these days of active feminism the concept of attaining true love through a role of total submission has some appeal to a large number of women this is the reality which has to be borne in mind by the viewer whenever watching this or any similar film tthis is a film which many will watch for its curiosity value but which will probably only appeals to a very small number within its limitations it is extremely well made and it is certainly not pornographic although there is plenty of nudity there are no shots showing either male or female genitals and no attempt is made to dwell on any of the violence just for titillation overall it probably deserves a reasonably high rating unfortunately i cannot give it this i am amazed at how accurately the scenes depicted in the film follow the written descriptions in the novel it is obvious that its makers took a great deal of trouble to ensure this my basic concern is that this disguises the fact the film completely reverses the message which the original novel

every way he can in one o begs sir stephen to permit her to commit suicide she would not do it without his explicit permission but he grants her this in the other she is returned to the training mansion to help teach her replacement what will be expected either of these endings convey the clear message that total submission does not lead to greater love but ultimately to contempt for the

purposefully awkward pacing that out of the way i would have to say that this is possibly one of my most personal favorite films it is dark tense atmospheric and filled with sounds and images that will send chills up your spine it is a film that takes more than one viewing to truly begin to comprehend but is quite a ride nontheless there are moments in this movie that will literally scare you so much so that one could almost call this eerie surreal art film a deconstructed domestic horror movie this film along with the original black and white night of the living dead are two of the only films in existance that still scare me to this day side note also i reccomend that you see luis bunuels movie un chien andalou to see where strange art films like this originated from anyway the films plot while initially incomprehensible to most can be broken down into the tragic tale of a man named henry spencer jack nance stuck in a dark decaying city overrun by industry during the film he is forced to deal with the prospect of taking care of an illegitimate premature child birthed by his girlfriend mary x charlotte stewart however he is consumed by his guilt and begins to comprehend suicide as a way out but the story is told through such a swirling mixture of dreamlike imagery that this is not always readily apparent however in order to better understand and appreciate the film one must figure out what each of the images mean heres a short cliff notes guidline to some of the more common recurring images in the movie the following contains spoilers worm sin these creatures appear all throughout the movie henry even tries to hide his little sin from mary at one point only to have a nightmare where mary is consumed by worms henrys room is also filled with piles dirt and dead plants as one might notice which makes his room a breeding ground for worms the baby the product of sin you might have noticed that the baby looks an awful lot like a worm futhermore the baby is a part of henry and later during the dream sequence we discover that henry is the baby when henry kills the baby he kills himself eraser memories henry feels that his memories or his brain with his bad memories is like an eraser that needs to be rubbed out in his dream sequence he sees himself losing his head and having his brains turned into eraser bits to be rubbed out and blown into dust on the wind the lady in the radiator death death looks grotesque yet strangely appealing to poor henry the radiator gives off warmth and seems to become a stage where death performs for henry promising to stamp out his sins worms and telling him that in heaven everything is fine at the end of the movie henry embraces the lady in the radiator before blackness falls the man in the planet god in addition to disposing of henrys cofessed sins at the beginning of the movie the worm coming out of henrys mouth the scarred man in the planet appears to prevent henry from opting for suicide during his dream sequence he silently reminds henry of his sacrifice the bleeding tree though it is in vain as henry shows god what he really is underneith the baby the last is a theme that occurs in all lynch movies electricity and electrical lighting the presence of good darkness the presence of evil there are other aspects of the film that keep popping up such as the reocurrence of the unlucky number thirteen henry waits thirteen seconds for the elevator to open up the lady across the hall takes thirteen seconds to appear henrys apartment numbers add up to the number thriteen etc also there are many other images which i will let you figure out on your own end of spoilers all in all the movie is quite an experience this is a film that you will either love or utterly hate for myself i managed to click with the movie from the first time i saw it and have enjoyed it since repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment of the film as you begin to notice more and more that you never saw before all in all i say that it is an excellent and extremely layered film with that i give you some fun facts about the movie the pencil eraser machine actually worked it was put together by lynch and a friend of his to this day lynch will still not disclose how he constructed the amazingly convincing baby creature though he claims is was created with substance objects that anyone could find around the house jack nances hair was incredibly malleable literally all it took was a little bit of trimming on either side of his head and some combing to get it to stand upright in order to get a better sense of textures for the film possibly for the organs of the baby lynch dissected a dead cat when driving around town with the henry hair jack nance would sit in the center seat while lynch

masterpiece for the prolific and intellectual you could not ask for better acting the acting in this movie is second to none robert duvall william holden faye dunaway peter finch ned beatty and a whole list of others perhaps the best acting in any film made whatsoever it starts with howard beale peter finch a victim of his own human pitfalls ossified and dejected from his declining years going from bad to worse he becomes isolated desultory morbid and morose and feels his life has no meaning he threatens suicide on live television and is discarded as being a wacko at first but guess what hes a hit so the ratings crazed cutthroats make him an instant success by labeling him the angry prophet denouncing the hypocracies of our time as long as weve gone this far lets break all of the rules bring on the terrorists the soothsayers the insurectionaries the financial gurus the faith healers and the para military radicals to reduce the severity of hard bitten news to a side show of carnival freaks william holden plays the old school business man with primal doubts about his life in general male menopause with defineable features he is happily married yet after being bombarded from all sides in the autumn of his years he is frightened that the new generation is impervious to basic tenets of human morality such as ethics and compassion the woman with whom he gets involved is callous not because she is vindictive but because she is emotionless this woman faye dunaway is the television incarnate ice queen who reduces time and space to split seconds and instant replays the daily business of life is a corrupt comedy and the only redeeming quality to modern marvels and a radiant eruption of democracy is that it gets a 32 share this acting performance is perhaps the best acting performance i have ever seen the type of person dianna christensen was supposed to be was played out perfectly the delivery of the elaborated monologues and diatribes were absolutely remarkable she was ideologically explosive yet person ably obtuse you knew why she wasnt the drinking type she was too emotionally detached in the thick of womens liberation whereby a woman wanted to be just like a man this movie portrayed how being just like a man had its drawbacks arousing quickly consummating prematurely and suffering from the cumbersome fate of being crippled by ineptitude at everything else but your work made dianna christensen perennially wistful of testosterone laden aggression aggregately she invoked societal demise through channels of deductive reasoning director sidney lummet was insistent that dianna christensen be utterly devoid of vulnerability mr hackett robert duvall played the hatchet man for the cca a rough around the edges errand boy for mr jensen ned beatty who viewed this network as his big chance and that whatever worked worked scruples were never an issue and ratings were pending exchange howard beale peter finch the angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our time surprised even himself with his charismatic clout with the naive television audience he was the ubs star lighted mad prophet of the airways he could arouse anger and counter culture overzealousness just by appearing crazy one speech mr jensen ned beatty was a bit role but incredibly powerful in his delivery of the basic concept that ideology is for sale and that television is the ultimate vehicle for manipulation paddy chayefsky is pioneer with this film as an acrimonious depiction for making world phenomena such as the fall of communism and landing man on the moon to be minimized to a market share the terms entertainment and egalitarianism now became pejorative the movie audience is hit with the terrifying reality that a societal caprice will induce the avaricious to capitulate to human catastrophe give paddy chayefsky and sidney lummet credit for unveiling the revelation that ratings and the dollar take precedence over humanity howard beale the decrepit alcoholic euphemistically transformed to the prescient paragon of intuitiveness was alright so long as his innocuous chastisements did not disrupt worldwide pecuniary acquisitions once they did he was quelled and thus deemed a total ratings chart disaster ultimately howard beale the once disheveled dipsomania cal curmudgeon turned messianic savonarola becomes the typification of the corporate guinea pig this movie is avant garde in its ability to convey the message of greed first democracy second or third depending on the sponsors of the howard beale show an incident was determined traumatic or not traumatic by its lucrative marketability potential terrorism is not terrorism if it means ratings the character assassination of all the people in this movie was at the grass roots level their avoidable flaws were entrenched as irreconcilable any people with any conscience whatsoever william holden amp his wife were decimated by reveille with selfishness now it is imperative that they pick up the pieces how many imitations of this movie have there been thousands network however was the first movie of its kind to effectively portray the concept of dying democracy and dehumanization probably the best movie of its kind as well this is an illustration of how heinous tragedy has to be stomached by the television audience their response to clinical trauma transcends the impact suffered by the actual victims involved it is a proverbial case of ratings eclipsing reality the film network resonates itself to a point whereby the american people are reduced

       " 'it brought audrey hepburn back to the screen after an absence of eight years it brought sean connery and richard harris back together again after their teaming in the molly maguires and it even brought back connery and robert shaw fourteen years after they fought to the death in from russia with love unfortunately at the time of its release it did not bring back audiences to the theaters for a movie going public acclimatized to the likes of jaws and rocky a film concerned with aging and loss corruption and mortality was not likely to find very wide acceptance today it is generally regarded as a classic and one of the best adult love stories ever filmed what do heroes do when its time to call it a day this is the problem confronting robin hood a legend in his own time on his return to sherwood forest after twenty five years of fighting in the holy land should he as old soldiers are said to do quietly fade away or go out in a blaze of glory unfortunately robin is as his great adversary the sheriff of nottingham wisely observes a little in love with death so it is unlikely he will slowly fade away and death hangs over the film like an unseen presence this central theme is given visual emphasis in one of the opening shots we see three apples set in an open window perfect at first then suddenly an abrupt jump cut showing them rot this motif of aging and corruption is repeated for the closing of the film as well we hear will scarlett sing about following jolly robin to the grave the mortally wounded richard lionheart confides to one of his lieutenants his dislike of the cold and dark when little john expresses his desire to go see his father again he is ruefully informed by friar tuck that he died years ago john the wistful reaction on little johns face eloquently expresses regret too profound for words visually and verbally death is a constant presence indeed the original script was titled the death of robin hood with a title like that it was not going to be a rehash of errol flynn and olivia de havilland and perhaps that also added to the films lackluster performance at the box office audiences brought up on the adventures of robin hood simply could not accept seeing these two beautiful star crossed lovers ravaged by time even if they were portrayed by the likes of sean connery and audrey hepburn however like the flynn film robin and marian boasts a superb cast sean connery gives one of his great performances his robin refuses to acknowledge the approaching infirmities of old age and like a great ex athlete attempts to make a comeback in a world that has long since left him behind nicol williamson woefully under used in most films has one of his best roles as little john the terrible gentle giant who follows robin with the unquestioning simplicity of a child he and connery have the essential chemistry necessary and make an incredibly good team robert shaw brings intelligence sensitivity and danger to the sheriff of nottingham a man who will ultimately be undone because of those very virtues richard harris does a magnificent turn as king richard the lion hearted even though burnt out by years of chasing after glory he still retains the after glow of greatness ian holm as his brother prince john is a wonderful contrast anxious and insecure scheming and pleasure loving his scene with the ambitious equally scheming sir ranulf the marvelously supercilious kenneth haigh highlights another of the films themes the passing of the chivalric age this is signaled by the death of king richard continues with the death of the sheriff and is completed by the deaths of robin and marian prince john and sir ranulf symbolize the ascendancy of the modern hollow man ambition without vision loyal only to power and expediency prince john is king as ceo interested only in profit sir ranulf like the armor he sports a soulless mechanical bird of prey denholm elliot as will scarlett and ronnie barker as friar tuck complete robins band elliott was an actor who could express more with a simple look than most actors can with pages of dialog and barker has some nice ironic moments as the friar finally robin and marian brought audrey hepburn back to the screen as radiant and lovely as ever seeing her first in her nuns garb recalls her appearance in the nuns story sixteen years earlier some people have an ageless beauty and audrey hepburn had that quality she and connery may be the best tragic lovers since humphrey bogart told ingrid bergman to get on that plane in casablanca their scenes together are magic when marian asks robin why he followed richard during all the years of terrible carnage connery sums up his life with a simplicity that is breathtaking he was my king the film is wonderfully elegiac and the melancholic sense of time irretrievably lost is heartrending james goldmans screenplay is quite simply his best surpassing his own adaptation of his play the lion in winter unlike that film goldman refuses to indulge in pithy witticisms at the expense of period flavor john barrys bittersweet score and richard lesters austere direction never descend into sentimentality and underscore the tragedy of the two lovers reunited after spending half a lifetime apart david watkinss gritty cinematography beautifully captures the squalor of life in the medieval age robin and marian is a

       " ' taxi driver starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer bernard hermann as we see the blurred city of new york as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion taxi driver is one of martin scorsese finest achievements as he teams up with robert de niro travis bickle de niro is the title character the acting as a whole is exceptional harvey keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named sport and he brings a forgettable character to center stage keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character jodie foster plays the prostitute under sports rule iris is 12 years old and for a 14 year old actress at the time foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material and she handles it incredibly well keitel and foster have a scene together where sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her its an utterly repulsive scene the look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of iris is pretty disgusting its extremely well acted even though its a pretty quick and minor scene in this one scene we see the type of control sport has over the young impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of these are the kinds of things that set travis bickle off the film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance recognition and notice the editing is very good the direction is great but its carried by a magnificent script from paul schrader and a great lead performance this probably stands as de niros second best work to raging bull and among the finest acting performances of all time travis bickle is the self proclaimed gods lonely man bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy crowded streets of new york city wherever he goes he goes unnoticed like a ghost meandering through lifes morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts his mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol the former vietnam veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of new york eat away at his consciences the first act of the films starts with a normal looking man with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city we watch bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust we dont see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness he decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a marine he meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a 44 magnum hes ready for war and the table is set the ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy the film strongly suggests a dream like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot possibly signifying bickles departure from the world of the carnage left in bickles wake then theres the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state what we do know is that travis bickle takes the lives of lowlifes degenerates and the scum of the earth hes treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions this is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause kill 5 scumbags save 1 the final scene of the film is also controversial we see betsy for the first time since their big fight and shes no longer disgusted with travis now the media has changed her opinion of him too travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film hes quiet reserved and humble he looks harmless as the ride home goes along we find out that palantine has won the nomination after travis drops betsy off he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple so long as travis drives off he menacingly looks back into the mirror representing a problem still exists then we fade back to the start of the film with the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting bickles brooding boiling rage within symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed the near death experience doesnt cure him the accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesnt make it any better hes still ready for war ',\n",

vanishes that next mission is the first manned landing on mars and it is going very smoothly indeed to the awe and excitement of the u s a and the entire world what the world outside of the space agency doesnt know is that the whole mission is fake its been set up and broadcast from a deserted military base 300 miles west of houston it seems a critical piece of equipment proved faulty too late to abort the project and so the space agency it is never directly called n a s a in cahoots with shadowy high government powers had pulled the three astronauts from the capsule moments before launch whisked them to the deserted base explained the situation pleaded for their reluctant cooperation through some not so subtle intimidation and all has been peaches and cream and now it looks like their re entry and landing will be near perfect albeit 200 miles off course so that they can get the spacemen back into the capsule nothing is going to ruin this mission so what if one of the console technicians has noticed that the tv broadcasts are earthbound not from space he simply disappears nothing is going to ruin this mission almost nothing a bad circuit in one of the other consoles claims that the heat shield has separated from the capsule upon re entry and all three astronauts burned alive in the capsule but they are alive and well in a deserted base in texas and they know that they

vietnam it was there that he envisioned how easy it could be for a huge government to cover up anything it wished in the post moonwalk years when some wing nut conspiracy groupies insisted nasa had faked the moon landing hyams found his base plot and it works like a charm the casting is near perfect dependable old hal holbrook is the head of the space agency in over his head and resigned to

puzzlement in his performance of a man who is trying to help but feels like hes to blame elliot gould just normally comes across to me as someone sleeping his way through a role but for this picture it is perfect for the character of reporter caulfield this sleepy cynical unenergetic man who is slowly putting the pieces together and too frightened to say his surmises out loud is deftly handled through goulds stock in trade persona i really felt that david doyle and telly savalas shouldve switched roles neither man was truly convincing in his performance and their characters might have been better served being traded between them however the real star of the film is bill butler the director of photography what he releases on your screen is an artful array of cinema the pull back and cross pan shots of the in studio mars terrain the terrifying out of control car gould is trying to avoid being pulverized in the quiet terror of hal holbrooks office as he makes and takes his telephone calls those evil insect like helicopters in landing or in flight the dark dread in the cave as brolin hiding from the pursuers confronts a nasty viper the stark dry brittleness of the desert that brolin waterston and simpson must challenge the strain and exhaustion of waterston as he scales the dry mountain side to escape his fate but in vain but most of all it is the exciting jolting

       " 'i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90s cant hold a candle to 70s and 80s horror films i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such i feel that they and others like them dont know what true horror is and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films i already own all the fridays so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre the original nightmare on elm street jaws the exorcist angel heart the exorcist and halloween now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do and that is it uses subtle techniques techniques that dont rely on blood and gore and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me no movie john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers he showed that you dont need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens but what is about to happen what was that shadow what was that noise upstairs he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today but they dont no one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares they use special effects and rivers of blood and it is just not the same you cant be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall its the moments when the killer is lurking somewhere you just dont know where that scare you and halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor in 1963 a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life silently locked up in an institute as loomis his doctor says to sheriff brackett i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out because what i saw behind those eyes was pure e vil that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants and all he wants here is to kill laurie no one know why he wants to kill her but he does halloween ii continues the story quite well what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror there is one scene that has to be described and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul she goes to the car and tries to open it only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house she gets them comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys the audience picks up on this but she doesnt she is too busy thinking about paul when she sits down she notices that the windows are fogged up she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist and then myers strikes from the back seat this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail we know what is happening and annie doesnt but its astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall dark rooms creepy and haunting music a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing relentless killer my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about after all carpenter followed in hitchcocks steps maybe directors should follow in his halloween personifies everything that scares us if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that dont know the difference between evil and cuteness then halloween is a film that should be seen it wont let you down i enjoy being scared i dont know why but i do but nothing has scared me in the 90s except maybe one film wes cravens final nightmare if you enjoy beings scared then halloween is one that you should see and if you have already seen it a hundred times go and watch it again back to back with a film like urban legend urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie halloween will have you frozen with fear stuck in your seat not wanting to move now tell me what horror film would you rather watch and just to follow up after seeing zombies version it makes you appreciate this that much more this is a classic by definition zombie bastardized his version but it doesnt take away from the brilliance of this one ',\n",

       " 'apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but its also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious palme dor at cannes and its constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history based on the novel hearts of darkness by joseph conrad this film is not so much about the vietnam war it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle the duality of man consisting of morality the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon the film has a simple premise us army captain benjamin willard martin sheen is ordered on a dangerous mission into cambodia through a river to assassinate a renegade colonel kurtz marlon brando who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe its an accessible premise allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers and yet this film is anything but shallow its a journey into madness and hysteria an observation into the darkness of humanity i could write a book analyzing this film theres just so much to talk about my interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the characters inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie dehumanization the journey through the river is also reminiscent of dantes perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors there are three major stops before kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters the first stop is with lieutenant kilgore that stop shows that kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and cant comprehend the consequences the war will bring in one scene of the movie the heroic marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies captain kilgore uses wagners ride of the valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures valkyries he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle at this stage although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy they still understand the innocent the second stop is the uso show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent at this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves the soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent the last stop before kurtz is the do long bridge and its at this point that a soldier has gone too far hes experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and cant return to a normal state of mind the final stop on the journey is kurtz at this point only willard and kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength bypassing the madness stage hes able to see the world for what it truly is filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself he kills kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted in the end willard has a choice succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken kurtzs place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates throwing his weapon he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didnt they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go the film presents this study of the human psyche through carmine coppolas eerie score hypnotic images and some haunting scenes essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell its here where coppola succeeds the most his ability to create a living hell is so amazing and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers it provides a commentary on war and religion making the subtext even vaster the film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves the cinematography by vittorio storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the films runtime from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank everything is captured in a stunning manner conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewers breath away coppolas direction transcends itself the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows most notable during col kurtzs first appearance the troubled production obviously didnt hurt the film at all and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays apocalypse now is beautifully haunting utterly hellish terrifyingly intelligent and magnificently wrought it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war but also its meaningfulness and beauty not only is this one of the best films ever made its a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own it is francis ford

       " 'released in a badly cut version in 1979 just before the resurgent interest in burt lancaster for his performance in atlantic city and peter otoole for stunt man this fine historical epic died an ignominious death at the box office on the second half of a double bill with the horror film silent scream it was originally planned by cy endfield as a companion film to his 1964 classic zulu that film opened with a voice over of richard burton speaking lord chelmsfords communication to prime minister disraeli detailing the massacre that befell a british column of about 1 800 british infantrymen and native contingents at the hands of zulu warriors at isandlwana on january 22 1879 this disaster left the 155 men at the mission post at rorkes drift to fend for themselves against several thousand zulu warriors headed their way zulu dawn chronicles the chain of events that led up to the british debacle at isandlwana the worst defeat ever suffered by a professional army at the hands of native forces in history director douglas hickox keeps the film moving along and the film is an excellent example of adapting historical events to the needs of cinematic form and drama in a little less than two hours the causes for the war as well as the roots of the disaster are laid out in clear if simplified terms the arrogance of the british empire as personified by sir henry bartle frere john mills in another stiff upper lip performance and his chief lieutenant frederick theisger lord chelmsford peter otoole nicely understated and subdued are in the filmmakers view clearly responsible for a war that need never have been fought at all the film also makes clear that sir henry initiated the conflict without the knowledge let alone consent of the british government but the arrogance and sense of entitlement that blinds sir henry to dealing with the zulu in a just and legal manner affects all the participants involved from the highest government official to the lowest private it is the mistaken belief that technology exemplified here by rockets cannons and rifles somehow gives nations the right to take by force whatever they want handing chelmsford his orders sir henry asks does this cover frederick what we both know to be right most excellently sir henry he replies it is as if they both need spoken confirmation that the crime they are about to commit is in fact justified this english disdain is not just reserved for the zulu but for fellow countrymen as well after col hamilton brown robustly played by nigel davenport refuses his table in order to be with his men still on the march chelmsford contemptuously warns his aide de camp lt hartford sensitively played by ronald pickup to learn nothing from that irishman except how not to behave but his real distaste is reserved for col anthony durnford a rough hewn irishman who has a way with the native troops with his understanding of the zulu warrior and his knowledge of the topography durnford would obviously be of great use in the coming campaign but almost immediately there is tension between the two men and with burt lancaster as durnford it is easy to see why chelmsford might feel threatened even with the use of only one arm he is a natural leader of men intelligent and charismatic and unlike chelmsford he respects the zulu it is one of lancasters sage portrayals and this time he sports an irish accent dialects were never one of his strong points and this one doesnt completely convince but it is consistent and it underscores durnfords isolation among the english who make up most of chelmsfords staff more importantly even at 65 lancaster has a bravado and dash which makes it understandable how he might warm the heart of beautiful young woman fanny colenso so loved the older durnford that she went on a one woman crusade to clear his name when the official inquiry into the disaster attempted to shift the blame for it onto him a great cast is well used in many telling vignettes denholm elliot as the gentle col pulliene has a moving death scene simon ward as william vereker represents what is best of the british aristocracy abroad and he quickly becomes disenchanted with the war a very dirty business indeed michael jayston as col crealock chelmsfords secretary catches all the charm and tact needed for that difficult position freddie jones and anna calder marshall as bishop colenso and his daughter fanny having lived among the zulu are righteously indignant at the prospect of war ronald lacey as correspondent norris newman delights in skewering the official lies about the war peter vaughn as quartermaster bloomfield whose obsession in accounting for every cartridge and shell would have such horrific consequences is marvelous simon sabela makes a very impressive king cetshwayo in one of the opening sequences to the film and bob hoskins as tough sergeant major williams is a lot of fun with great battle scenes and a rousing score by elmer bernstein

in the movie is faithful to the book some dismiss the movie as trivial however consider this brooke christa shields was 14 years old born 1966 when she played emmeline lestrange she had already appeared in 12 prior films christopher atkins was making his movie debut at the age of 18 years born 1962 playing emmelines cousin richard lestrange referred in the book by the diminutive name dicky lestrange in the book emmeline is 8 years old and dicky is 8 years and a bit when the story starts emmelines father died before she was born two years later her mother died her uncle and fathers brother arthur lestrange veteran actor william daniels took guardianship of emmeline in boston mr lestrange purchased a small estate in los angeles and was in route by clipper ship to san francisco around south america the ship named northcumberland had departed from new orleans bound for san francisco having rounded the cape of south america and going off course during a calm a fire breaks out in the hull of the ship the cook paddy button played expertly by veteran australian actor leo mckern took emmeline and dicky aboard a dinghy launch and attempted to row a safe distance away from the ship before it exploded from gunpowder stored on board mr lestrange and ships compliment were separated in the fog from paddy emmeline and dicky after the ship blew up mr button and the children drifted in the south pacific ocean for about three days and nights until they were brought by the tide to an island named in the book as palm tree island somewhere in the ocean southeast of the marquesas islands in the movie we see a boston newspaper with a date that appears to be 1893 floating in the water the children and paddy button are saved and set up housekeeping as shipwrecked survivors for the first 45 minutes of the movie child actors elva josephson and glenn kohan play emmeline and dicky elva only acted in three movies and two tv appearances while glenn appeared in this film only and acted no more however they did a good job playing themselves as eight year olds on the island paddy tries to be father and mother to the children he teaches them the basics of survival gathering fresh water harvesting bananas from trees catching fresh ocean fish capturing small rabbits knot tying hut building making a signal fire making a tree calendar to mark the days and exploring the flora and fauna and caves of the island they had rescued a trunk of clothes that the children use as dress up and play items also there were three dimension view photos of the day of adults in social activities these photos would be useful to educate emmeline and dicky in some social graces of civilized people emmeline had found a keg of rum and a skeleton of another shipwrecked sailor when they first arrived on the island after two years on the island paddy drinks himself to death it is curious that this small keg would have lasted for two years being the rummy that paddy was as he tells the children that he has many children in ports around the world however the children discover paddys dead body and conduct a burial ceremony as best as they could dont look for this on the tbs edited for content version as its not there tbs spoils the movie by cutting out what they feel are sensitive parts of the movie albeit necessary for continuity of the story to retain its tv 14 rating this is not a childrens movie this is a young adults movie the rudimentary scenes are necessary to be faithful to the book if the rating ends up being r so be it also this is far from being a soft porn movie as some reviewers suggest this is a story about how people can survive in the late 1800s on a deserted south pacific island without the niceties of the then civilized western world enter teens brooke shields and christopher atkins at about the age of 14 years the story picks up as the children have entered into puberty brooke emmeline begins to become aware of her changing body turning her into a woman and she experiences these changes alone and confused without another woman to help educate her likewise chris dicky is becoming a man and brooke although the same age in the story is more mature than chris and is becoming sexually attracted to chris emerging manhood what was once childs play and tickle touch between children is now sexually sensitive to young emerging teens critics this is nature at work the moviemakers did a wonderful job of portraying this on film of course they discover sex but they do not know that it produces children emmeline and dicky marry each other in a ceremony they devise to show that they are civilized they begin to live together as husband and wife ultimately emmeline becomes pregnant and finally is aware that there is something growing within her fast forward to the bogeymen on the other side of the island a tribe of natives had from time to time come by boat to the other side of the island here they had a stone idol and sacrificial alter at least six times during the film even when paddy was still alive the survivors heard distant drumbeats paddy knew the danger and passed a law warning the children never to go to the other side of the island after paddys death emmeline and dicky do go to the other side and discover the idol emmeline thinks it is god the edited version leaves out the night spying and confrontation of dicky with a native get the full version for this humane meeting of east meets west oh these are not african peoples this is a south pacific movie the natives are supposed to be polynesians in the book emmeline has her child all alone on the floor of the forest while dicky is returning from spying on the natives in the movie dicky returns in the nick of time to witness the childs birth no matter thats hollywoods movie license of course uncle richard has continued to pursue finding his son and niece the book explains how he comes to know where the children might be he hires a ship to search the area of the palm tree island ultimately emmeline dicky and baby paddy now about 2 years old in the book she names the boy child a girls name hannah because she likes the name put out to sea in the dinghy that is still seaworthy after being shipwrecked for eight years and five months after losing their oars during a shark attack the survivors without food or water drift in the ocean for three days before uncle richard discovers them the movie ends as faithful to the book ending the trio is rescued when the rescue boat rows out to intercept the dinghy mr lestrange asks are they dead the ships crewman replies no theyre asleep beautiful brooke and handsome chris are not to be made fun of they acted remarkably well portraying children with limited education and vocabulary the island scenery is beautifully photographed there is a wonderful special effect when brooke baths in the ocean get the video as tbs took a hatchet to these frames if you were living in that era and shipwrecked and survived you would want your eight plus years on the island to be like brooke and chris spent in this film get the video and enjoy its an adult film for mature teens and older adults ',\n",

       " 'rocky iv 1985 is definitely one of the best sport action films of the 80s it is my number one favorite best movie in the rocky series i love this movie to death and i dont care what anyone says it was my first film i saw it as a kid it is my childhood film and i grew up with this movie sylvester stallone did gave us one of his the most best performances of the rocky character ever this film along side with rocky iii is very underrated misunderstood bashed and dissed off from fans and its critics i love this film to death and it has a special place in my heart the film has everything that i love in a rocky film it is fast paced and entertained from beginning till end the film goes very fast is not boring dull or lame it is actually pretty good film is not bad is actually good the fourth installment of the rocky series isnt the greatest film like were his predecessors but it is still a good film people its not that bad in fact its really good okay it isnt a classic like the first two movies were and it suffers further by comparison to rambo first blood part ii which came out six months before it but part iv was still one of the best movies of its year 1985 that fight at the end was epic just amazing as for the music bill conti is great but so is vince dicola vince is a genius on synthesizer music the fight at the end was a literal clash of the titans level bout and his music fit it so perfectly rocky iv remained the highest grossing sports movie for 24 years before it was overtaken by the blind side it is the fourth and most financially successful entry in the rocky film series as a kid rocky iv was always my favorite best movie it still is alongside with rocky i iii and balboa it is sad that apollo dies in this movie i hated that but the rest was pretty fast entertaining well faced paced entertained action movie this is the first movie that place actually took in a different country and not in the us i love when rocky sylvester stallone flys to russia to fight the best undefeated champion ivan drago dolph lundgren the training sequences were awesome the fight sequences were entertained and very paced amazing the soundtracks for this movie were pretty awesome and great james brown living in america was awesome the fight between rocky and drago was set on 25th december christmas this is the first rocky film where the music is not composed by bill conti the fourth movie was one of the best sport action movies directed by sylvester stallone he made such a great wonderful performance i love you sly without you there wouldnt be rocky i have heard a lot about this film carl weathers as apollo creed and dolph lundgren as ivan drago really did not get along and got into an a real fight during filming lundgren threw weathers across the ring before it was broken up you can even see the scene during a press conference regarding the match hostility is created between apollo and dragos respective camps the fight really went out of hand carl weathers shouted profanities at lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie sylvester stallone forced and convince those two macho ego actors to comeback and finishing the film the major problem with this film i have is killing the most best awesome character apollo creed in rocky sequel almost everyone dies the killing one of the most favorite characters was one of the worst idea stallone ever had in rocky iii mickey dies in rocky iv apollo dies in rocky balboa adrian dies stallone kept killing our favorite characters but he memorized them the movie wasnt filmed in russia which that really disappointed me and i think stallone should have visit russia and film at least one scene there i love sound effects and rocky iv is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants and a bevy of other new special effects i love everything that it is about this film everything when east meets west the champion remains standing rocky balboa heavyweight champion of the world is the trainer for apollo creed in an exhibition match against ivan drago a superman boxer from the soviet union when apollo is killed in the ring by the brutal drago balboa blames himself and promises to avenge his friends death in the ring that is the basic and simply plot of the most awesome sport action film of the 80s rocky iv is a 1985 american sports film written and directed by sylvester stallone who also starred in the film the film co stars dolph lundgren burt young talia shire carl weathers tony burton brigitte nielsen and michael pataki that is the basic plot of the awesome sport action film the rating i am giving a 10 i love this film to death i grew up with it and it is my number1 favorite rocky film ',\n",

       " 'come and see 1985 i first saw this movie a couple of years ago i didnt really know what to think of it at first the soundtrack on the dvd is a little messy and the acting was a bit strange i knew it had affected me though in a way that not many other movies had as time went by i began to realize just how much of an impact the movie had on me it really really stuck with me one night while writing a review of errol morriss latest documentary fog of war i found myself thinking more and more about come and see and decided that i had to watch it again immediately i ran out after midnight and rented it and watched it 3 times or so over the next week i started to see why the film had been haunting me and sticking around my thoughts the reason was that this movie is simply a masterpiece elem klimov directs the film starring aleksei kravchenko as florya a young boy who desires to fight with the partisans army against the invading nazi army he digs until he finds a rifle then the next day he is off to a camp in the middle of the woods the scene is chaotic it seems and unorganized the fighters try to take a photo that takes about 5 minutes to accomplish because everyone keeps messing up their positions florya spots glasha olga mironova a young girl who has the younger fighters swooning over her and who also seems to have some sort of relationship with the leader of the camp what that relationship is exactly we never find out florya gets left behind on the attack because he is perhaps too young and besides another older fighter needs some new boots and swaps with the new kid the anxious florya is upset by this decision and he takes to the woods for some solitude he cries and then discovers that near by glasha is also crying at being left at the camp more so for being left alone than behind the two begin to bond and end up in an open field when german planes attack and begin to bomb the encampment the scenes that follow next teeter on the brink of madness on film come and see is likely one of the most maddening films ever made for that matter the key is the soundtrack florya is struck deaf for a few moments by the bombs sounds are muffled but not like anything youve ever seen in a hollywood film the soundtrack is a mix of strange ringing and sounds and music adding to the atmosphere of chaos that the two youngsters have now been thrown into much of the film has this style of soundtrack which makes the floryas descent into madness much more poignant the film movies forward from here back to floryas village which has now been deserted the two head to an island on the other side of a bog where florya believes the town is hiding along with his mother and sisters the scene where they climb through the mud is another example of florya losing his mind the soundtrack again becomes ambient and menacing in its strange blends of sounds they eventually find some villagers and florya now even more loses his sanity along with some of his hair which is given to recreate a statue of hitler this will be the last time we see glasha in the movie as florya goes with a party to collect food for the starving people the most famous scene and the one that will likely never leave you is of a village being ransacked by nazi soldiers the scene is chaotic and culminates in a barn stuffed with the townspeople being burned and shot apart another one of the most famous shots from the movie is of florya shooting a photo of hitler each bullet making time reverse the photo goes back in time until it is a picture of hitler as a baby on his mothers lap he is an innocent infant and florya cannot bring himself to fire another shot these shots are incredibly powerful and they stick in your mind obviously come and see was filmed with influences of soviet propaganda in it but it hardly matters because it is so well made and so maddening you cant help but be totally absorbed by the experience the movie has a hypnotic quality about it and without being horrifying because its a jump out of your seat surprise bloodbath it is horrifying in its representation of the cruelty people are capable of in war i cant remember ever seeing another film that expressed the descent into madness any better and being so involving as come and see by the end of the film you feel like youve just experienced what it must be like to lose your mind the film never goes into the desensitizing of violence in war instead it focuses on the violence which causes those who witness to become desensitized from the madness of its cruelty elem klimov created this film out of his actors and their emotions and essentially used the viewer as another character this movie draws you in and makes you experience exactly what the characters must there are few other films that do that to you especially to the extent that this one does it and for that come and see is not only a masterpiece its really one of the best films youll ever see find it but dont just watch it allow it to take you in even if that means you have to see it a couple times let it take you in and youre in for an experience rarely found in cinema anymore',\n",

       " 'for georgian cinema every film of t abuladze was a landmark each project was at least the most typical if not the best film of its time visually they all are made in different style and form defined by or sometimes defining the trends in the contemporary georgian cinema spoilers ahead the major achievement of tengiz abuladze himself is a trilogy the plead tree of wishes and repentance these films got a wide critical acclaim and repentance even became the major hit in ussr many soviet and post soviet critics and viewers consider it to be the best soviet film of 80 ies the phrases and notions from this film became proverbs and are quoted everywhere general concepts repentance and the way to the temple where over abused by soviet media for over a decade but some foreign critics were much less agitated by the film leonard maltin even found it boring while in ussr the film was often criticized for being too entertaining on the contrary film by nikita mikhalkhov on a similar subject burnt by the sun was very well received in the west while in former ussr it was simply excoriated by critics as a shallow hollywood oriented soap and a definite cash in on the glory of repentance some foreign critics and viewers didnt understand anything about the repentance which is full of symbols and allusions some of them are uniquely georgian apart from the stalin criticism here are some facts about the film that foreigners mostly do not know 1 the story is a real one beria the darkest evil character of stalin epoque crushed a well known painter after he attempted to protect the metechi temple a trade mark of tbilisi capital of georgia that beria planned to destroy to build some monument as always everyone who opposed beria were arrested and mostly executed but the temple symbol of spirituality human values heart of a nation survived 2 due to this the prologue and epilogue of the film are very important by the way there are 2 time periods in the film the past stalin time totalitarian regime the present brejnev period so called zastoi standstill stagnation period time of conformism when everything became seemingly all right so the prologue and epilogue is the picture of the soviet zastoi of 70 ies everything seems to be all right and a child of family destroyed by totalitarian regime makes cakes with beautiful but fake temples on them eventually the cake is eaten be a dirty little bearded man admiring the totalitarian past and speaking about varlam aravidze read stalin beria and all other monsters from the past with admiration and the cake maker the victim of varlam says nothing and just imagines what could she do to remind people of truth but this is just her imagination people are conformists they need no truth and only old vagabond woman searches for the way to the tample 3 the axis of the film is aravidze family aravidze in georgian means nobodys son we see 3 generations varlam the totalitarian past his son abel and his wife the innocent conformist present and tornike the grandson the future that finally must take the responsibility for the crimes of past 4 but this taking the responsibility for the crimes of past is a controversial issue thats why everything happens only in the imagination of the cake maker becouse the degree and a form of repentance and the repentance itself is a very complex and painful matter and yes the skeleton in the closet affects and punishes not varlam who commits the crime but abel who tries to hush it up and tornike who is among few really innocent characters of the film digging out the corpse of varlam the past is this a solution the authors leave the question to the viewers 5 some scenes need explanation the funeral may look grotesque but in fact its pretty realistic and is more a humoristic critique of georgian obsession with ceremonies georgian cemeteries are really the monuments of human vanity huge with excessive use of marble granites and other materials putting cage on the grave of varlam is symbolic but in general the episode depicts how unholy the sacred places have become in soviet union georgia the episode with church shows the same the church is transformed into power station episode in the greenhouse is a naked gun like literal depiction of the expression under the cap to have someone under control during his inauguration speech varlam makes a statement that became quintessential when depicting stalin regime he cites confucius its hard to catch cat in the dark room especially if it is not there and paraphrases it we will catch the cat in the dark room even if its not there for those who have little idea of stalinism the accusation for making a tunnel from bombay to london may sound forced but in fact its very realistic and sounds rather tame next to some other accusations based on which millions of people were killed episode with goddess of justice has dual symbolism first the goddess has become a lady of dubious reputation playing piano with a stalinistic prosecutor second the actress making cameo appearance here appeared in the first part of the trilogy as well the plea there she was a symbol of beauty and purity 6 the

       " 'when i watched this movie i steeled myself for a traumatic experience based on every review id ever read of it which usually include phrases like dont watch this if youre suicidal instead if i had to pick a single word to sum up the movie i saw it would probably be beautiful certainly it was sad and arguably depressing but ive read this movie compared with saving private ryan thats ridiculous grave of the fireflies is gentle and poetic more often than its violent and its remarkably restrained in its anti war message it simply tells a story theres very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics why would a story like this need such heavy handed tactics ive also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when its revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead i have a quite different view of that device firstly the beginning of fireflies is for all intents and purposes a happy ending this is such a non linear plot development that you could fail to notice it and thereby only see the movies gloom the moment where the ghostly seita takes the ghostly setsukos hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment it signifies that the suffering which is yet to come as far as the viewer is concerned is over and they are together again albeit still without parents as for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie this is a device which has been used in centuries if not milena the crucial thing here is that fireflies isnt about tension it tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know a legitimate narrative approach and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending you find yourself hoping that things will go right now for setsuko and seita and then the knowledge that ultimately it wont undercuts you with real emotional power you know the characters are going to die but you hope things wont be so bad in the meantime it doesnt take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives which makes us all fireflies perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that its so damn honest i mean that its one of the most honest artifice free movies ive ever seen it doesnt even really try to ram an anti war message down your throat there is very little overt violence and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering its never gratuitous and its over quickly compare this with private ryan where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts only to reach a conclusion which after much blood and thunder signifies very little fireflies otoh has far more beauty than gore this is what really surprised me about it probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn tranquil rural or urban settings with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality even when the american bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal almost serene sense to it and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes perhaps best of all setsuko is one of the very very few if not the only animated 4 year old ive ever seen who actually behaves like a four year old im so sick of seeing preternaturally smart sassy sophisticated and precocious children in hollywood movies setsukos emotion and behaviors are exactly right for a completely normal four year old and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy similarly seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride compassion and hubris which youd expect of someone his age he still believes that japan will win the war he thinks its up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where this leads him to make mistakes possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmers advice swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again you would probably have to say his decision not to even try to go it alone instead was a very bad one but hello people here is a character who makes mistakes because hes actually human a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation who doesnt miraculously save the day because his best judgment just isnt good enough of course his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway who knows dont go into the film expecting tension drama or even a tirade against war its a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth if you think japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls this could be the film which changes your mind its slow poetic beautiful and sad and extraordinarily honest i must be the only person who didnt cry during this film and i mean i get choked up during some disney movies yes it is sad but its beauty and honesty is what ill remember nb this review refers to the subtitled version of the film ',\n",

       " 'very big spoilers youve been warned i explain the entire film here so if you dont want to have it explained read no further i did receive an e mail from the screenwriter of this film thanking me for understanding his movie after i posted this comment on amazon years ago i really think its an underrated film that people misunderstand and everyone can relate to on some level vampires kiss is an overlooked and misunderstood dark comedy and an allegory for the isolating fear of intimacy that can mimic being undead it features an amazing physical comic performance by nicholas cage as peter loew which deserves recognition ive read reviews wherein people feel that the character of peter loew has descended into madness as a result of being a jilted lover but his madness is more about his crushing loneliness in a world where everyone around him seems to be happily and easily paired off in spite of his solitude he is emotionally unable to connect to anyone one night he brings a woman back to his place but while in the throes of passion a bat flies into his apartment through an open window the mystery and excitement of fighting off the bat becomes more erotic and interesting to him than the willing beauty in arms terrified of the closeness he craves he sabotages any opportunities he has for actual relationships in favor of elusive fantasies and hallucinations his fear of commitment manifests itself as a vampire lover in the form of rachel jennifer beales a woman he has had one conversation with in a bar but has never made it with except in his own fantasy world there she is a dominatrix of a vampire sucking the life out of him making him a prisoner of her demands hungers and lusts distracting and preventing him from any real intimacy promising him that soon he will be with her the vampire is the only one to whom he can say i love you and she doesnt even exist not really she represents the promise of something more exciting right around the next corner peter simply cannot commit to anything else when love and immortality are so close but so far vampires seem human but they arent human they feed on humans theyre dead cold and isolated from the warmth of human existence which is exactly how peter feels and why he believes hes becoming one plus he is suicidal and he seems to have found a way to receive deliverance in the form of his secretary alva who he begins to torment in earnest once he discovers she carries a gun hoping shell justifiably use it on him its over the top and a little hard to understand but i found this movie so engaging and cages performance so funny and astonishing in spite of the dark subject matter that i have watched it over and over again i have used this movie as a compatibility test for potential mates which is sort of peter ish i guess and if they like it i know its a good match if it had been performed another way by another actor i dont know if i would like it at all but cage brings brutality vulnerability tragedy and all out desperation together to create a complex character the like of which i have never seen before or since sure there are violent scenes but are they real or are they his imagination well never know so much of vampires kiss happens in loews mind that all we know for sure is that hes desperately alone so alone hes willing to drive someone else over the edge to help ease his pain hes so cowardly and childish that he uses terror as a way to achieve relief from his horrible solitude death is less frightening to him than actually getting close to a real person therein lies the horror and the sadness of vampires kiss and in cage lies the performance which makes this story watchable and actually very funny ',\n",

       " 'its hard for me to believe that fourteen years have passed since i first saw this movie i was only ten at the time and this was the first movie i ever saw that was both an eye filling and a mind filling spectacle it was also one of only two theater going experiences that i ever had with my late grandmother and i always think of her when i watch this movie it always takes me back to an earlier time in my life no matter how many times i see it this is one movie that could only have been made in the post vietnam era when americans began to question the moral integrity of their country how else to explain in the opening sequence depicting the civil war the utter cynicism of the soldier who speaks with costners dunbar character or dunbars later observation that there was no dark political objective to the sioux battling the pawnee the scene in which dunbar receives his orders from the mentally ill major also seems to speak of vietnam the point being i think that while an entire generation of young men was being cut down in the civil war the west was being managed by those who were not fit for duty in the larger conflict maury chaykin in that one scene gives one of the most memorable and haunting performances ive seen in any film this movies depiction of native americans is not nearly as politically correct as it may seem to those who watch it only once or only at a superficial level in the very first scene depicting indians in fact a pawnee brave shoots one of the white characters full of arrows and then scalps him the unrepentant villainy of wes studis character in particular recalls the moral simplicity of countless earlier westerns even the most sympathetic indian character in the movie kicking bird is not kind to dunbar merely to be friendly but because he believes he can get useful information out of the white soldier about the other whites who are encroaching on sioux territory the interaction between dunbar and the sioux is powerfully effective precisely because the sioux remain true to themselves they are not cartoonishly hostile like the indians depicted in old westerns but they are not soft or na u00efve either while this movie draws its inspiration from american epics as diverse as the birth of a nation 1915 and the searchers 1956 its originality lies not only in its respect for native americans but also in its intensely personal treatment of the main character few other three hour epics lawrence of arabia and braveheart come to mind have developed their protagonists as fully and dynamically as this movie develops costners dunbar character even after fourteen years the dunbar characters arc going from a suicidal soldier in the opening sequence to an adopted sioux who in the final scenes puts the needs of his people ahead of his own is still one of the most remarkable ive seen in any movie costners performance won no awards that i know of but it provides the movies indispensably tight focus hes completely convincing every step of the way if a bit too clumsy and self effacing at times hitting his head in the dark and fainting after a confrontation in a heavy handed attempt to demystify the west another quality this movie shares with the searchers is that it associates the physical challenges of the frontier with the testing of the soul the dunbar character cleans out the watering hole at the fort because he refuses to lose his humanity like the men before him who abandoned the fort later he cannot decide whether he feel more or less at home in the presence of the sioux because he is struggling to remain true to himself even as he remains unsure of who he is this movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment its a quiet thoughtful story and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters particularly dunbar rather than on the action itself you wont see any computer generated comic book characters in this movie but you will see real people having real conversations and youll see costner and costar mary mcdonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that youll forget theyre acting if i could rate the musical score for this movie by itself id give it a perfect 10 because its one of the best ive ever heard able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove it is sentimental without being schmaltzy noble without being pretentious best of all it captures the hesitant emotions of the story the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust only this movies extreme length works against its total success particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours the three hour theatrical version is still long but its difficult to say what should have been left out of it some people still resent the fact that costner won the best director oscar over scorceses goodfellas theres no question that scorcese is the better director but i believe the direction of dances with wolves is better than that of goodfellas if you disagree with me try this test imagine that scorcese did this movie and costner directed goodfellas its a question of which directing job is better not which director is better unlike most epics this movie ends exactly as it should the final images such as the journal floating down the river the white man and the native american speaking english to each other and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff are so beautiful and dreamlike that they manage to be both joyful and sad this is a movie that looks into the very fabric of this countrys past and asks us to do the same rating 10 good job everybody ',\n",

       " ' note over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon raise the red lantern is one of the most extraordinarily beautiful movies i have ever seen the sets are exquisite tableaux carefully arranged decorated and framed and then shot from an attractive angle the scene as they drag the third mistress kicking and screaming to the tower of death with the snow falling so peacefully onto the rooftops was chilling in its effect the startling blaze of color light and detail within the houses set against the drab simplicity of the courtyards continually provided a contrast between life within the protection and at the favor of the master and life without this dichotomy is symbolized in the vibrant red lamps and the somber blue hue of the lamps when they are covered in this manner the mistresses are controlled i was also struck by the sonorous beauty of the accompanying chinese music but more compelling than the beauty of the film is the story director zhang yimou tells a tale of paternity and imperious privilege set in early twentieth century china he begins with the newly arrived fourth mistress 19 year old songlian a university student who because of the death of her father is forced to quit school she chooses to marry a man of wealth she is warned by her stepmother that she will be a concubine she replies isnt that our fate her cynicism and then her robust energy in seeking her ascendancy over the other sisters engages us and we identify with her struggle what is extraordinary about zhangs direction is how easily and naturally the personalities of the characters are revealed the first mistress big sister is too old to be of any sexual interest to the master yet she is the mother of the eldest son the second mistress who has given the master only a daughter still dreams of having a son her devious schemes and plots are hidden by smiles and fake good will toward her sisters the third mistress an opera singer still vibrant and beautiful in a fascinating performance by the intriguing caifei he uses her allure in vying for the masters attention songlian in spite of herself finds herself caught up in the competition with the others gong li who plays songlian is very beautiful with a strength of character that one quite naturally admires she has the gift as does for example julia roberts of being able to express a wide range of emotion with just a glance of her very expressive face serving as a foil to the mistresses and perhaps as the most poignant victim of the concubine system is the servant girl yaner played with a compelling veracity by kong lin she is occasionally how shall i say this for amazon touched to use songlians term by the master and so she dreamed of being the fourth mistress but when the fourth mistress arrives her dreams are shattered and in her jealousy she hates songlian and plots against her one of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when songlian thinking yaner has stolen her flute forces open the servant girls room and finds it flooded with well you should see note well that the master is only hazily observed he is a personage a man of wealth that is enough to know about him he is as interchangeable as the harem masters on a beach of elephant seals but because he has wealth he can engage concubines who must compete with one another through him to find their station in life one gets a sense of what it might be like in the harem system practiced by gorillas and the sheiks and warlords of old one pleases the master not because one loves the master although one does of course because humans tend to love their masters but because in pleasing the master one rises above the others thus the triumphant call light the lanterns in the third house most people no doubt lament the life of the mistresses yet women in poor places may wish such a life upon themselves but concubines are just prostitutes really one might say trapped by a system of male privilege but i would remind those who see only that that for every wife the master has that is one wife another man will not have the system does not favor males it favors wealth and privilege in such a system there are many men without wives fomenting unrest which is why modern states forbid polygamy what does a man do with the capital he accumulates or inherits if the system allows he spends it on women and the assurance of his paternity and why is that possible because many women songlian is our example would rather be the fourth wife of a rich man than the first and only wife of a poor man many women would rather be used by a man of wealth than rule the household of a nerd this is the way humans are and any sexist interpretation of this movie misses this truth the real horror depicted here though is in the brutality used to maintain the system not in the polygamy itself the women who follow the rules and beget the masters children especially if they are sons enjoy a pampered and secure existence those who do not are dealt with severely branded as mad or even murdered note the similar experience of the wives of henry viii for example within the english system of serial monogamy this is a great movie like a timeless novel fully realized directed by a visual genius from a script of great psychological power

       " 'i blame the downfall of the alien films partly to this movie its when the movies went from being masterpieces to pieces of s e its not as bad as regurgitation but its leaning that way more towards that than towards its predecessor weaver is almost unbearable too look at with her shaved head and hicks and newt are dead that right there is enough to p me off this movie could have been so much better than this and come on now a prison setting please dont waste my time i usually like david fincher so i can forgive him for this but it still stinks 6 10 ',\n",

       " 'wow where to start on this movie i think this one really just killed the series first off by killing of hicks newt and kind of bishop at the very start plus there were so many plot devices it was scary the characters had no depth to them except for ripley dillon clemens and maybe aaron they tried to make you care about them eg after the quinacetraline explosion when they have the sad toned music and the prisoners who survived walk slowly down the halls finding the dead ones and taking them away kind of like the bring out your dead scene in monty python and the search for the holy grail except not funny but theyre prisoners why would you honestly care about them and the movie itself was just plain boring everything was either silver or sepia toned there were long periods where absolutely nothing happens but this is different from aliens case the first movie there are long uneventful periods because it adds to the creep factor in this theyre there because they want to save the few action sequences for the end however i will say in its defense i liked the ending a different turn from the first to and rather poignant seeing as theres this woman who is tormented every waking moment of her life by these alien creatures and she finally has no choice but to give up but all and all a very weak entry to the series i dont like david fincher now the special edition is so much better all that extra stuff they cut out made the film much more watchable golic going crazy releasing the alien and all that extra stuff for me it raised the watch ability rate to about a 6 5 rather than a 4 in conclusion if youre going to see alien3 see the special edition not the theatrical ',\n",

       " 'i am a big fan of the alien series and own both of the first two movies after watching alien 3 again recently though i was reminded how horrible it was it was very cheap and reminded me of a bad made for tv movie it rearranged the rules that were set up in the first two movies and switched all sorts of things around this is the worst movie i have ever seen ',\n",
       " 'one major beef i had with alien3 was the condescension on ellen ripleys part namely the scene where she is chastising the warden for not having weapons of any sort it is a prison planet after all and given its circumstances hardly not understandable overall i found the movie bothersome and annoying an unnecessary sequel that offered little to the mythology or to the moviegoer ',\n",
       " 'alien 3 is a textbook example of how too much studio control can destroy a potentially decent film after the massive success of aliens the studio wanted yet another film to bring in more profit that makes perfect sense to me if you have a good thing going then why not milk it but heres the problem aliens ended with very little wiggle room in which to make another film for all intents and purposes it was the end of the story as alien 3 went through various drafts the numerous writers attempted to bring new things into the story regarding the aliens for example william gibsons screenplay had the idea of the aliens having an alternate means of reproduction via spores a very neat idea mind you and the descriptions of the transformations in the script wouldve made for very horrific imagery on film unfortunately alien 3 decided to throw any good ideas out the window and magically place an alien egg aboard our heroes ship despite the fact that in the previous film we are shown that the queen has left her eggs at the hive and im just getting warmed up another common gripe about alien 3 is the death of the characters newt and hicks many fans of the film felt that it was necessary and that it helped eliminate the happy ending of aliens i personally dont think it was a bad idea to kill off the characters except that it was executed poorly on screen their deaths carried no meaning other than to forcefully make ripley a fish out of water again not only that but newt and hicks who were engaging characters are replaced by uninteresting stock characters who serve no other purpose than to be cannon fodder now the previous two films had their share of cannon fodder but they at least left you wondering who exactly was going to die example few suspected that ripley would be the sole survivor of alien lastly people complain that alien 3 was nothing more than a retread of the original film thats very true except that unlike alien this film didnt work instead we are treated to a rather formulaic slasher like storyline the ending is one of the few parts that truly work and it serves as an excellent bookend to the series director david fincher who was unfortunately reduced to the level of studio puppet does manage to save the film with his talent in creating a moody atmosphere one can only wonder how much better this film might have been had he been given a greater amount of control alien 3 could best be described as the great sequel that never was given a more interesting script and more control on the directors part this film couldve been at least as good as its predecessors fortunately fox took a step in the right direction with alien resurrection by having entertaining characters and a more original story ',\n",
